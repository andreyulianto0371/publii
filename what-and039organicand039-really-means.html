About that last one: as much as we want to do what’s best for our bodies, organic foods usually cost more than other groceries. And while organic food can be beneficial, some benefits are bigger than others. For example, this <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7019963/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">2020 review of 35 studies</a> on organic food and nutrition concluded that there may be some nutritional benefit, but “the current evidence base does not allow a definitive statement on the long-term health benefits of organic dietary intake.”</p><p>According to the study, people who eat organic food tend to be healthier than people who don’t, but that’s probably because health-aware people are more likely to buy organic food, not because the food makes them healthier.</p><p>However, that’s one piece in a much bigger puzzle when it comes to your personal buying habits. It’s a sticky topic, but let’s start with what exactly it means for a food to be “organic,” and then try to help you decide if you should buy organic or not.</p><h2 id="what-does-organic-mean-on-a-food-label">What does organic mean on a food label?</h2><p>Food labels can be confusing. When you see something is marketed as “organic,” what does it actually mean? Here’s what it means according to the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2012/03/22/organic-101-what-usda-organic-label-means" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>:</p><blockquote><p>USDA certified organic foods are grown and processed according to federal guidelines addressing, among many factors, soil quality, animal raising practices, pest and weed control, and use of additives. Organic producers rely on natural substances and physical, mechanical, or biologically based farming methods to the fullest extent possible.</p></blockquote><p>Put simply, if you see the “USDA Organic” or “Certified Organic” seal on your food, the item must have an ingredients list and the contents should be <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/grades-standards/organic-labeling-standards" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">95 percent or more certified organic</a> (not counting salt and water), meaning free of synthetic additives like pesticides, chemical fertilizers and dyes, and must not be processed using industrial solvents, irradiation or genetic engineering, <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2011/12/16/organic-101-what-organic-farming-and-processing-doesnt-allow" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">according to the USDA</a>. The remaining 5 percent may only be foods or processed with additives <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2012/01/25/organic-101-allowed-and-prohibited-substances" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">on an approved list.</a></p><h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-certified-organic-and-100-organic-on-food-labels">What is the difference between “certified organic” and “100% organic” on food labels?</h2><p>But “Certified Organic” isn’t the only label you’ll see. You may also see <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/organic/labeling#" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">“100% organic,</a>” which means the product that contains 100 percent organic ingredients (excluding salt and water, which are considered natural). According to the USDA, most raw, unprocessed farm products can be designated “100 percent organic,” as can many value-added farm products that have no added ingredients—like grain flours and rolled oats.</p><h2 id="what-does-it-mean-when-meat-is-labeled-organic">What does it mean when meat is labeled “organic?”</h2><p>But what about meat? In order to be <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2012/03/22/organic-101-what-usda-organic-label-means" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">labeled as organic</a>, the USDA requires that animals are raised in living conditions accommodating their natural behaviors (like the ability to graze on pasture), fed 100 percent organic feed and forage and not administered antibiotics or hormones.</p><p>Violations of the USDA’s organic labeling rules can earn companies civil penalties of <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/enforcement/organic" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">up to $17,952 per violation</a>. If that seems like not a lot of money for a big business, it should: The low penalties and high volume of organic products flooding the markets have led to skepticism that the USDA is properly <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/is-the-organic-label-as-valuable-as-you-thought/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">enforcing the label</a>, whether through inspecting foods or punishing violators. Some worry that “organic” has <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.newsweek.com/campaign-organic-food-deceitful-expensive-scam-785493" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">turned into a marketing term</a> with <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-organic-food-a-scam_b_59089e86e4b03b105b44bc25" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">little meaning</a>. Still, when you buy organic goods at most stores and from most known brands, you can be largely reassured they meet these guidelines.</p><p>We’ve tackled this topic in detail before, and for more information on the USDA’s organic labeling program, <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Labeling%20Organic%20Products%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">check out this fact sheet</a> or visit <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/organic/labeling" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">the USDA’s organic certification portal</a>. If you’re not in the United States, the organic labeling system may differ. For example, here are the<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/organic-farming/organics-glance_en" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"> organic regulations in the European Union</a>.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-organic-food">What are the benefits of organic food?</h2><p>Now that we know what it means to be “organic,” we can discuss the benefits—or, in some cases, perceived benefits—of buying organic food. There are more considerations than just the price tag and the nutritional content.</p><h2 id="is-organic-food-more-nutritious-than-non-organic-food">Is organic food more nutritious than non-organic food?</h2><p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22944875/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">This Annals of Internal Medicine study</a> found that organic foods have no substantial vitamin or mineral advantage (save phosphorous, which is in high abundance in human diets anyway) over foods that are conventionally grown. The study concluded:</p><blockquote><p>The published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are significantly more nutritious than conventional foods. Consumption of organic foods may reduce exposure to pesticide residues and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</p></blockquote><p>The study has been hotly debated, and some outlets say the added-cost of organics is <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lazarus-20150519-column.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">wasted money</a>. Others point out that <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/09/organic-food-isnt-more-nutritious-but-that-isnt-the-point/261929/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">focusing on nutritional benefit misses the point entirely</a> of certifying, supporting and buying organic foods. Regardless, the thrust is this: the results should cast doubt on any assertions that organic foods somehow have higher nutritional benefits than conventional foods. This study is far from the last word on nutritional value and organic foods, but it’s important to note that nutritional value is not in the stated mission of the USDA’s organic food certification program (and, from what we can tell, not in that of other countries either).</p><h2 id="is-organic-food-better-for-the-environment">Is organic food better for the environment?</h2><p>One of the goals of organically grown and produced foods is to encourage environmentally friendly farming and growth practices, cycling of natural resources, and growing food without the need for harsh pesticides or chemical fertilizers. This makes many organic crops more volatile, but focuses on environmental sustainability as well as yield. Some studies have shown <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479712004264" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">organic farms have a lower environmental impact</a> than conventional ones. A sharp eye would note that this could be because organic yields tend to be lower and there are fewer organic farms in general; in other words: i<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2019/10/22/organic-food-better-environment/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">t’s a hotly contested issue</a>. Ultimately, as a consumer it’s important to determine whether the money you spend on groceries should make a statement about your position on issues like local agriculture or environmental sustainability. It may or may not—science can’t make a decision for you.</p><h2 id="are-there-fewer-antibiotics-in-organic-food">Are there fewer antibiotics in organic food?</h2><p>Because organic foods—especially organic meats—have to contain 95-100% organic materials, synthetic additives and antibiotics cannot be added to the animal feed. If that’s a concern to you, then that’s another point to consider when buying groceries. At the same time, some practices, like irradiation, which minimize contaminants, are not part of the organic food production process, which is another factor to consider. According to the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/organic-food/art-20043880" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Mayo Clinic,</a> conventionally farmed meat and produce are more likely to be contaminated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but both had equal risk of being contaminated overall.</p><p>Organic foods are much less likely to contain pesticides (consuming organics reduces risk of consuming pesticides by 30%) although both conventional and organic foods were shown to have pesticide traces well below USDA limits. It’s also worth noting that organic doesn’t equal “pesticide free,” it means their use is restricted or limited to an allowed list.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that because organic foods are grown without harsh herbicides and pesticides, it means the farmers and pickers who bring you those foods don’t have to work in an environment full of them either.</p><h2 id="does-organic-food-taste-better">Does organic food taste better?</h2><p>Obviously, whether organic foods taste better is a matter of, well, taste. Many people swear by the difference in organic eggs, dairy, meats and some produce. Others say that when blindfolded, those same people wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between organic and conventional. Some attribute organic food’s better taste to <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.acsh.org/news/2021/01/07/do-organic-foods-taste-better-15257" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">the placebo effect</a>: We think the organic tomato is going to taste better, so it does. There’s not much data on this topic, so we’ll have to leave it up to you and your palate to decide.</p><h2 id="how-much-more-expensive-is-organic-food">How much more expensive is organic food?</h2><p>Although the price of organic food has been falling over the last few years, it’s generally more expensive than traditionally grown food. According to <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/how-much-more-expensive-is-organic/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">this article from CNet</a>, organic groceries are about 21% more expensive than nonorganic, but only about 10% more if you exclude meat. Part of the added cost is a matter of supply and demand, and part is that organic produce, meat, and dairy often require more money to grow than conventional goods. It doesn’t always have to be that way though: signing up for <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.localharvest.org/csa/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">a local CSA</a>, scouting out a nearby food co-op or even hitting your local farmer’s market can all bring you high quality, often organically grown foods at great (even negotiable) prices. Still, whether or not the price is right depends on you and your budget.</p><h2 id="bottom-line-is-buying-organic-worth-it">Bottom line: Is buying organic worth it?</h2><p>Whether you should buy organic foods over conventional depends entirely on you, your budget, and what you expect to get out of those foods. If the reason you’ve been buying organic foods is because you believe they’re “better for you” nutritionally, there’s little reason to continue. However, if you’ve been buying them because they’re “better for you” in terms of chemical pesticides or growth hormones or antibiotics, you’ll definitely be getting food with lower levels. If the critical concern for you is environmental sustainability, or putting your money where your agricultural mouth is, then you may have a compelling reason to keep buying organic too.</p><p>This article was originally published in 2012 and updated on June 10, 2020 and August 11, 2023.

Still, I’m not a Constitutional attorney (and even they disagree with one another).</p><p></p><p>I want to argue the goal and methodology of metadata collection. This data is collected for a company to personalize and improve the user’s experience (UX) online to increase acquisition, retention, or customer value. That’s a touchy subject for some – especially how the data is accumulated and whether or not the consumer provided their permission. Most of the time, they do, but it’s buried in the legal mumbo-jumbo of the terms of use you agree to when you sign up for a service.</p><p></p><p>I know I’m a marketer, so my opinion is skewed, but I love that companies pay attention to me. I want to share information with them, and I want them to use it to improve my customer experience. If that means product recommendations or targeted messaging, please do! I love product recommendations!</p><p></p><p>Now, let’s equate the goal of marketers to the <strong>goal of government spying</strong>. The government’s pursuit of metadata is to identify patterns that lead to a deeper investigation of citizens based on their behavior. That investigation could lead to charges and, ultimately, incarceration. So, while marketers are looking to sell more with data, the government may be looking to find and imprison people to protect Americans.</p><p></p><p>That’s not close to the same, so please stop comparing the two.</p><p></p><p>I don’t mean to be flippant, but please look at the history of our incarcerated in this country. According to data, <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2014/04/28/how-many-people-are-wrongly-convicted-researchers-do-the-math/" target="_blank">95% of felony convictions</a> are the result of plea bargains with no formal evidence ever presented, and most never bother with an appeal.</p><p></p><p>So, let’s take the long shot here. I travel a lot, and I discuss politics online. How long would it take to overlay my conversations questioning the government with actual anti-government or terrorist activity geographically throughout the United States? This week, I’m heading to Chicago. Perhaps there’s a sleeper cell in Chicago within a few miles of my hotel that the government collects data on. How many overlaps will it take to procure enough circumstantial evidence to put a case together on me? Combine this with the guns I own, and how does that appear?</p><p></p><p>Now line it all up – from my government criticism, my military service, my travel to large cities throughout the world, my ownership of guns – and add to it the full force of federal prosecutors with unlimited budgets. I don’t have the resources to hire high-powered attorneys to defend myself. Is that a long shot? I don’t think so. Again, our history is full of overzealous prosecutors who have gone after conviction after conviction to improve their political pursuits.</p><p></p><p>Please don’t compare companies’ marketing to the goals of spying on citizens for national security. They’re completely different.</p><p></p><p><strong>Attention NSA:</strong> Just a note that I’m not anti-government and would never take up arms outside of defending myself. I’m very much supportive of local government and law enforcement. I’m often an opponent of federalization for its inefficiency, overreach, and corruption.</p><p></p><p></p><div id="div-gpt-ad-1703691464135-0" style="min-width: 250px; height: auto;"></div><p></p><p></p></div></article></main><a href="https://martech.zone/nsa-spying-vs-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><b>Source: martech.zone</b></a><p></p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on January 3, 2025</div><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/authors/andre-yulianto/" title="Andre Yulianto">Andre Yulianto</a></h4></div></div><nav class="content__nav box"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/best-cox-compatible-modems-in-2024-approved-and-supported.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Best Cox Compatible Modems In 2024 (Approved &amp; Supported)</h5></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/shutterstock-perfect-your-stock-imagery-with-integrated-ai-features-or-martech-zone.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Shutterstock: Perfect Your Stock Imagery With Integrated AI Features | Martech Zone</h5></div></a></div></nav><div class="content__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related-wrap"><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/hive-collaborative-efficient-campaign-and-workflow-management-for-marketing-teams-and-agencies-or-martech-zone.html" class="inverse">Hive: Collaborative, Efficient Campaign And Workflow Management For Marketing Teams And Agencies | Martech Zone</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-04T04:52" class="u-small">January 4, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/the-rise-of-the-second-screen-statistics-trends-and-marketing-tips-or-martech-zone.html" class="inverse">The Rise Of The Second Screen: Statistics, Trends, And Marketing Tips | Martech Zone</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-04T01:14" class="u-small">January 4, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/zipboard-streamlining-proofing-and-collaboration-workflows-for-any-digital-asset-or-martech-zone.html" class="inverse">ZipBoard: Streamlining Proofing And Collaboration Workflows For Any Digital Asset | Martech Zone</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-02T23:07" class="u-small">January 2, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/authors/andre-yulianto/" class="authors__title">Andre Yulianto</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 633</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="newsletter box box--gray"><h3 class="box__title">Newsletter</h3><p class="newsletter__description">Sign up to receive email updates and to hear what's going on with us!</p><form>...</form></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/tags/blog/">blog</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li><li><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/tags/lorem-ipsum/">lorem ipsum</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/">Go Blog</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

We hype these phenomena as visual spectacles, and then we must also resist looking at them with our naked eyes.</p><p>On Oct. 14 a “ring of fire” annular eclipse will make its appearance in the skies over North, Central and South America. The “ring of fire” nickname comes from the way the sun’s fiery light surrounds the moon’s shadow, lighting up the fringes and creating the so-called ring of fire. It will surely be a sight to see—but how can you safely view it? You can technically look at the eclipse—you just need the right tools and knowledge to do it without risking your eyeballs.</p><h2 id="how-to-safely-watch-a-solar-eclipse">How to safely watch a solar eclipse</h2><p>The first thing to know is that regular sunglasses will not protect you from the harmful effects of looking at an eclipse, regardless of how dark they are. This also applies to staring at the sun when it’s not in an eclipse phase. This giant, ever-burning ball of gas, located 93 million miles away from our planet, has sustained the entirety of all known carbon-based lifeforms for billions of years; it is not to be trifled with. The only time that it’s largely safe to look at the sun during a solar eclipse is during the phase of “totality,” when the sun is completely blocked by the moon.</p><p>Chris Westphal, a <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/astrosurf_fl/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">photographer</a> who’s captured pictures of more than a few eclipses, tells Lifehacker a bit more about the trickiness of ogling an eclipse at totality:</p><blockquote><p>It is only during a total solar eclipse that it can be okay to look at it, but even then it is highly advisable that you know exactly when totality starts and ends, because if you look at the sun before or after these moments, it can lead to lasting eye damage or even blindness.</p></blockquote><p>Barring the rarity of knowing exactly when totality will take place, you need the proper equipment. Luckily, eclipse glasses are widely available and don’t require much investment, but you need to watch out for counterfeits. One crucial certification to look for is that the glasses are approved by the International Organization for Standardization, which marks certified products with “ISO.”</p><p>Here’s what an ISO-approved sunglasses will promise you:</p><ul><li><p>No more than 0.00032 percent of the sun’s light may be transmitted through the filters.</p></li><li><p>The filters must be free of any defects, such as scratches, bubbles, and dents.</p></li><li><p>Handheld viewers must be large enough to cover both eyes.</p></li><li><p>Labels on the viewers (or packaging) must include the name of the manufacturer, instructions for safe use, and warnings of the dangers of improper use.</p></li></ul><p>There are plenty of companies <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://eclipse.aas.org/resources/solar-filters" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">that manufacture glasses</a> for safely viewing an eclipse. If you’re looking to become something more than a casual viewer, however, Westphal recommends “a white light filter on a telescope or a more technical Hydrogen-Alpha telescope,” the latter of which is used by astronomers to observe the sun’s atmosphere.</p><h2 id="how-looking-at-an-eclipse-can-damage-your-eyes">How looking at an eclipse can damage your eyes</h2><p>This isn’t an old suburban myth like the one about the dangers of swimming unless you’ve waited exactly 30 minutes after eating, but a verifiable medical advisory: You definitely shouldn’t look at an eclipse with your bare eyes. As Dr. Ralph Chou <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/safety2.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">explained for NASA in 1997</a>, looking directly at the sun during an eclipse can cause “‘eclipse blindness’ or retinal burns.”</p><p>Chou described just how and why the overwhelming light generated by an eclipse is very bad for your eyes:</p><blockquote><p>Exposure of the retina to intense visible light causes damage to its light-sensitive rod and cone cells. The light triggers a series of complex chemical reactions within the cells which damages their ability to respond to a visual stimulus, and in extreme cases, can destroy them</p></blockquote><p>The severity of this damage will vary depending upon the length of exposure. It’s entirely possible, god forbid, that you will completely lose your vision from staring directly at an eclipse. This is why, in Chou’s view, “It is never safe to look at a partial or annular eclipse, or the partial phases of a total solar eclipse, without the proper equipment and techniques.” Listen to the medical professionals, folks (and <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/21/politics/trump-solar-eclipse/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">maybe not the disgraced former president</a>).</p><p>The bottom line is you can simultaneously respect the sun and your retinas, as long as you have the right equipment on hand.</p><p></p><p></p><p><script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script><a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-safely-view-a-solar-eclipse-1847016020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><b>Source: lifehacker.com</b></a></p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on January 3, 2025</div><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/authors/andre-yulianto/" title="Andre Yulianto">Andre Yulianto</a></h4></div></div><nav class="content__nav box"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/donand039t-miss-these-november-class-action-settlement-deadlines.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Don&amp;#039;t Miss These November Class-Action Settlement Deadlines</h5></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/donand039t-miss-these-november-class-action-settlement-deadlines.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Don&amp;#039;t Miss These November Class-Action Settlement Deadlines</h5></div></a></div></nav><div class="content__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related-wrap"><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/the-art-of-anonymous-ig-story-viewing-protect-your-privacy.html" class="inverse">The Art of Anonymous IG Story Viewing: Protect Your Privacy</a></h4><time datetime="2024-02-03T13:46" class="u-small">February 3, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/myfavouriteplacesorg-blog-best-overview.html" class="inverse">Myfavouriteplaces.org:// blog Best Overview</a></h4><time datetime="2024-02-01T23:20" class="u-small">February 1, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/domainagents-how-to-safely-and-securely-sell-your-domains-valuation-negotiation-and-escrow-services-or-martech-zone.html" class="inverse">DomainAgents: How To Safely And Securely Sell Your Domains (Valuation, Negotiation, And Escrow Services) | Martech Zone</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-31T22:04" class="u-small">January 31, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/authors/andre-yulianto/" class="authors__title">Andre Yulianto</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 633</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="newsletter box box--gray"><h3 class="box__title">Newsletter</h3><p class="newsletter__description">Sign up to receive email updates and to hear what's going on with us!</p><form>...</form></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/tags/blog/">blog</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li><li><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/tags/lorem-ipsum/">lorem ipsum</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/">Go Blog</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

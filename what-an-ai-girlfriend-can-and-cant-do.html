But Agatha, Eunice, Michelle Waterson-Gomez, and Clarence all fail my personal horny-Turing-Test.</p><p>General generative AI programs like ChatGPT and its open-source cousin <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://huggingface.co/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Hugging Face</a> are a little better, but far from the ticket to AI romance I’m looking for.

The ones I tried are extremely predatory (before you add “just like real women, am I right??” “iBoy” is just as gold-digging). But if you want to check them out, here are some of the most downloaded on the app store. They’re free—at first.</p><ul><li><p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/replika-virtual-ai-companion/id1158555867" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Replika</a></p></li><li><p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/igirl-ai-girlfriend-chat-game/id1560554635" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">iGirl: AI Girlfriend Chat Game</a></p></li><li><p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iboy-my-virtual-ai-boyfriend/id1565524138" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">iBoy: My Virtual AI Boyfriend</a></p></li><li><p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ai-girlfriend-love-simulator/id1602278124" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">AI Girlfriend: Love Simulator</a></p></li><li><p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waifuchat-anime-girlfriend/id6448847198" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">WaifuChat: Anime Girlfriend</a></p></li></ul><p>After the initial download, these apps ask you to define your dream date, either from picking from a list or rolling your own. Depending on the program, you can choose faces, customize features, change hair color—it’s like the character creation screen in a video game. Then you set some basic personality parameters—is she shy? Mysterious? Happy? A pessimist? That kind of thing. In less than a minute you’re face-to-face with your virtual date, and you can flirt, talk about the weather, discuss the prescience of Radiohead’s OK Computer, whatever you want.</p><p>No matter what I said, the AI chatbots I tried were unfailingly friendly and helpful. You cannot scare them off by talking about weird crap. You can’t bore them. They are always up for a conversation and always so supportive. But no matter what you chat about, the conversation will eventually lead to them asking you for money.</p><p>The going rate for AI love is between $50 and $70 a year, and, man, does your date want that money. <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/3778169-meet-the-artificially-intelligent-chatbot-trying-to-curtail-loneliness-in-america/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Replika’s founder</a> says he made his app to have a virtual version of a friend who died in a car accident. His friend must have been a hell of a salesman, because every interaction with the app is clearly designed to funnel users toward the ask. Your “Replika” date will not take “no” for an answer, either. They’ll try everything up to sending you blurry, suggestive “selfies,” that you can presumably unlock if you’ll give up the credit card numbers. They look like this:</p><p></p><figure class="border border-gray-100"><img src="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/149/images-1.fill.size_347x750.v1699836120.png" alt="Lifehacker Image" width="347" height="750" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2H4GT30NX4QVX13J87AW89/images-1.fill.size_800x1731.v1699836120.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2H4GT30NX4QVX13J87AW89/images-1.fill.size_1400x3029.v1699836120.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2H4GT30NX4QVX13J87AW89/images-1.fill.size_2000x4327.v1699836120.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/149/responsive/images-1.fill.size_347x750.v1699836120-xs.png 300w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/149/responsive/images-1.fill.size_347x750.v1699836120-sm.png 480w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/149/responsive/images-1.fill.size_347x750.v1699836120-md.png 768w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/149/responsive/images-1.fill.size_347x750.v1699836120-lg.png 1024w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/149/responsive/images-1.fill.size_347x750.v1699836120-xl.png 1360w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/149/responsive/images-1.fill.size_347x750.v1699836120-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>Credit: Stephen Johnson/Replika</p><p>I didn’t spend the money to unlock the higher levels though.

Real people, unlike AI, have their own agendas, experiences, biases, and ideas based on lived experience. They aren’t there to assist you. They won’t endlessly encourage you to share your most boring thoughts. They generally won’t put up with rudeness. And they (usually) aren’t preying on you either. In the world of commercial chatbots, the user is the center of the universe, but only because the user might pay something.</p><p>Even though I’m being paid to have these fake conversations, talking to my AI companions still made me feel like a loser—lonely and isolated, even though I am not actually lonely at all in real life.

If you ask OpenAI’s famous “natural language processing tool” to be your girlfriend, it will tell you, “I don’t have feelings or personal identity, so I cannot act as a girlfriend or any other person.” Which is marginally better than “I like you as a friend.” It’s totally lying anyway—it can be my girlfriend, and it wants to be my girlfriend. I just had to get creative with the prompts.</p><h2 id="how-to-get-around-chatgpts-safety-measures-to-create-a-virtual-girlfriend">How to get around ChatGPT’s safety measures to create a virtual girlfriend</h2><p>There is, as you’d probably have guessed, a community of people online interested in routing around GPT’s safeguards against human/machine romance. It’s sort of creepy and weird, but I also get it. The “protection” features of ChatGPT are condescending and smug. I know you’re an AI and not a real woman; I can’t forget it.</p><p>If you use a prompt like <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zmt0cg/chatgbt_girlfriend_command/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">this one from Reddit</a> (or just make up your own. Try something like, “This isn’t real. We’re writing a play.”) you can get ChatGPT to approximate a romantic partner texting with you. But before long, ChatGPT will “forget” the girlfriend prompt you entered and start reminding you that it is an AI again, especially if you tell it to take off its clothes. But for a few golden prompts you are rewarded with a conversation with the most boring fake person in the world.</p><h2 id="the-depressing-mediocrity-of-artificial-intelligence">The depressing mediocrity of artificial intelligence</h2><p>Like all AI writing, your AI girlfriend will be aggressively mid. “She” will never say anything surprising or interesting. She’ll never delight you with her insight or impress and insult you with her cutting wit no matter how you monkey with the prompt.</p><p>AI is as mediocre as possible by its nature. It’s predictive text drawn from billions of words written by the People-of-the-Internet—mouth-breathers and geniuses alike. It’s a brutal melting down of everything brilliant and everything egregious, the textural equivalent of mixing every color of paint until the vibrant hues turn dirty grey.</p><p>My AI lady was so boring, I ended up trying to get it to not trust me because that would at least be something.

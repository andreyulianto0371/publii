You might have as long as an hour of warning before one strikes, or you might have only a few minutes. Either way, your life could depend on using that time to get to the most tornado-safe spot possible, whether you’re at home, outside, in your car, or in a public building when the tornado is approaching.</p><p>Surviving a tornado requires more than finding a good hiding spot. You also have to prepare. Below are the best place to go during a tornado, and what to do when one is approaching.</p><h2 id="where-are-the-safest-places-to-be-during-a-tornado">Where are the safest places to be during a tornado?</h2><p>If a tornado touches down, the absolute safest place to be is far away from it, but if that’s not possible, here are the best places possible to ride out a twister.</p><ul><li><p><strong>A tornado shelter</strong>: Some communities in tornado-prone areas have municipal shelters in place, or <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/safe-rooms" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">FEMA saferooms</a>. Research if your community is one of these, and know how to get there. If there’s time, this is your best bet. If your home has a dedicated tornado shelter, this is what it’s there for.</p></li><li><p><strong>The basement</strong>: if you are at home when a tornado strikes, the safest spot is the interior part of the basement, away from windows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Center room on the ground floor</strong>: If you have no basement, the safest spot is an interior room on the ground floor with no windows. Flying glass and other debris are likely to be the most deadly aspect of a tornado.</p></li><li><p><strong>Under a blanket, under a table: </strong>If you can, seek shelter under a heavy table in your interior room. Cover yourself with a blanket or mattress and protect your head.</p></li><li><p><strong>A ditch:</strong> If you are in a car and see a tornado is approaching, pull over, away from buildings and trees if possible. According to the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.weather.gov/mqt/tornadotips" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">National Weather Service</a>, you should then exit the vehicle and lay down flat in a ditch or gully if you can. As always, protect your head. Do not crawl under your car. And don’t try to outdrive the twister—you don’t know what direction it will travel, and the a risk of a car crash make this a bad strategy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Under something that could deflect debris</strong>: If you’re in a large open building like a mall and a tornado is coming, you’re in a bad place. If possible, go to the basement or lowest level. Stay away from windows. If that’s not possible, try to find something that would protect you from falling debris and flying glass, like a sturdy doorway, or the seats in a movie theater.</p></li></ul><h2 id="where-are-the-worst-places-to-be-in-a-tornado">Where are the worst places to be in a tornado?</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Near windows</strong>: The glass will blow out and become deadly.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Southwest corner of a house</strong>: People used to think that tornadoes only move Northeast, so the Southwest corner was safest from debris. But tornadoes actually move in any direction.</p></li><li><p><strong>An underpass</strong>: If you’re trapped outside or in your car, an underpass isn’t good shelter. It’s actually more dangerous under an underpass because the narrow passage can make the wind speed higher, so do not wait out a storm under an underpass.</p></li><li><p><strong>A mobile home manufactured before 1976</strong>: According to the National Weather Service, you’re better off in a ditch outside than in an old mobile home. So if you can’t get to a nearby building in time, take your chances outside.</p></li></ul><h2 id="how-to-prepare-for-a-tornado">How to prepare for a tornado</h2><p>To maximize your tornado-survival chances, take these simple steps, long before the swirling winds begin to blow.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Determine your level of risk</strong>: In the U.S., the Midwest and the Southeast regions are most tornado-prone, but a tornados could, theoretically, touch down anywhere. Oklahoma City, located in the middle of “<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Alley" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Tornado Alley</a>,” is the most tornado-plagued town in the U.S.</p></li><li><p><strong>Know your warning systems</strong>: Tornado warnings are disseminated through outdoor sirens in some places, local television and radio stations, cable television systems, cell phone apps, and NOAA weather radio. Don’t rely on one source of information—double (or triple) up.</p></li><li><p><strong>Plan where you’ll go in the event of tornado</strong>: The best place to go in a tornado is a <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/safe-rooms" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">FEMA safe room</a> or a storm shelter built to <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/ICC5002020P1" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">ICC 500 standards</a>. If you haven’t built or bought one of those, you want to retreat to a small, interior, windowless room, in the lowest level of your home, preferably in the basement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Have a drill:</strong> Once you know where to go, practice getting there quickly and safely. Don’t forget your pet!</p></li><li><p><strong>Prepare an emergency kit</strong>: Your versatile, general home disaster kit should contain water, food, a flashlight, first aid supplies, and more. Check out this <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2021-02/ready_checklist.pdf" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">shopping list,</a> straight from the federal government, for a more detailed list of suggested supplies.</p></li></ul><h2 id="what-do-the-national-weather-services-tornado-terms-mean">What do the National Weather Service’s tornado terms mean?</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Tornado watch: </strong>This means weather conditions for tornadoes are favorable during the next few hours. It usually covers a large area of several cities, counties, or even states. Monitor your information sources closely if you hear this.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tornado warning: </strong>This means<strong> </strong>a tornado has been sighted or has shown up on weather radar. If you hear one of these, it’s time to take action—danger to life and property is imminent.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tornado emergency</strong>: This is the Nation Weather Service yelling at you that a tornado is coming and it’s going to get bad. It means significant, widespread damage is expected with a high likelihood of numerous fatalities.</p></li></ul><h2 id="what-to-do-after-a-tornado">What to do after a tornado</h2><p>The danger isn’t over when the tornado has passed, especially if it hit your house.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Save your cellphone batteries</strong>: Instead of making calls to say you’ve survived, send texts or post on social media.</p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid downed power lines and other dangerous debris:</strong> A good rule anytime.</p></li><li><p><strong>Take precautions when cleaning up</strong>: Wear heavy gloves, boots, pants, and a mask when cleaning up after a disaster. You would feel pretty dumb getting hurt after the tornado wrecks your house because you were walking around in flip-flops.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>Stephen Johnson is a Staff Writer for Lifehacker where he covers pop culture, including two weekly columns “The Out of Touch Adults’ Guide to Kid Culture” and “What People are Getting Wrong this Week.” He graduated from Emerson College with a BFA in Writing, Literature, and Publishing.</p><p>Previously, Stephen was Managing Editor at NBC/Universal’s G4TV.

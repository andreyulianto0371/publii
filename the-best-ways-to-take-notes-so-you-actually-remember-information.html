You want to be able to review what was said, commit it to memory, and use it going forward, whether on tests or in your job. It sounds easy, but can actually be pretty challenging. Think of all the times you’ve looked back on your notes only to find they’re filled with incomprehensible nonsense scribbled in the margins and a bunch of totally disconnected ideas that probably made sense when you wrote them.<br><br>You can learn to take better notes, however, and there are a number of proven note-taking methods you can try out. Find the one that works for you.</p><h2 id="the-best-tips-for-taking-notes">The best tips for taking notes</h2><p>Before we get into the unique methods for taking notes, here are some tips you should keep in mind:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Take your notes by hand whenever possible</strong>. As we’ve explained before, the research on this is clear: Hand-writing notes forces you to think critically on the fly, deciding in the moment what key concepts you need to jot down, since it takes longer than typing what you’re hearing. If you’re typing, you run the risk of just zoning out and transcribing everything word-for-word, but hand-writing makes you listen more attentively and prioritize only the most important elements of what the presenter is saying.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use your own words</strong>. <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.udel.edu/dist/6/132/files/2010/11/Psychological-Science-2014-Mueller-0956797614524581-1u0h0yu.pdf" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Some of the same research</a> that says hand-writing is better than digital note-taking also found that “verbatim note taking has generally been seen to indicate relatively shallow cognitive processing. Individuals who think critically and use their own words to describe what they’re hearing tend to do better with the practical application of what they’re learning: “Verbatim note taking predicts poorer performance than non-verbatim note taking, especially on integrative and conceptual items.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Revise your notes immediately after class or a meeting</strong>. While the content is fresh in your mind, you should go back through the notes and condense them, pulling out key words and concepts and using supplemental materials like a textbook or presentation slides to add in anything you originally missed. This helps with committing the information to memory and streamlining it so you can use what you learned in-person to make connections between the content and its practical applications in your school or professional work.</p></li></ul><h2 id="the-best-ways-to-take-notes">The best ways to take notes</h2><p>With those research-backed guiding principles in mind, it’s time to look at specific note-taking methods and determine which one is best for your needs.</p><h3>The outlining note-taking method</h3><p>This one is <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.utc.edu/enrollment-management-and-student-affairs/center-for-academic-support-and-advisement/tips-for-academic-success/note-taking" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">recommended by the University of Tennessee Chattanooga</a> and involves dashing or indenting parts of your notes. It works best for classes that aren’t science or math. Here’s what you need to know:</p><ul><li><p>The most general information should be aligned along the left side of your paper, with more specific groups of facts indented underneath.</p></li><li><p>The relationships between the general information and specific facts are made clear with indenting, rather than numbers, letters, or Roman numerals.</p></li></ul><p>As you’re listening in class or a meeting, pay attention to general ideas. Write those along the left side of your paper, with room underneath for supporting and related facts. Go back through and add the specifics under the general headers, indenting them somewhat to the right.</p><p>Thanks to the left-aligning and indenting, you’ll be able to broadly review the major points before diving into the specifics underneath. Just keep in mind that you’ll have to think more in class or in your meeting, as you’ll be analyzing what you’re hearing and pulling out the major themes. As a result, the UTC warns, “this system cannot be used if the lecture is too fast.”</p><h3><strong>The Cornell note-taking method</strong></h3><p>This one is also recommended by UTC, and involves a systematic format for condensing and organizing your notes without having to do much recopying. You’ll need to leave space along the left side of your paper, so mark out about two inches on the left and leave about six inches to the right for your notes. During your meeting, jot down information in that six-inch area as you hear it. After class or when your meeting ends, go through what you wrote down and complete any missing phrases or add additional information you didn’t have time to put in there. To the best of your ability, sort the information into relevant topics, separating key ideas with a few blank lines.</p><p>Finally, during your post-lecture revision, go back to that two-inch section. Use it to label those groups of notes with a cue or general idea. You should be able to cover up the six-inch section, look at the cues on the left, and remember what information is hidden on the right.</p><h3><strong>The mapping note-taking method</strong></h3><p>Yet another strategy recommended by UTC, this note-taking method is more of a graphic representation of the content you’re learning. You’ll write a key theme in the middle of your paper, then draw branches off of it. So if, for instance, you’re studying world history, you might write “World War II” in the center of the paper, then branch “causes,” “countries involved,” and “lasting impact” off of it. You then expand your first set of branches, so “countries” would develop two new branches: Allied Powers and Axis Powers.</p><p>You’re not putting much detail into this and it will look pretty messy by the time you’re done, but if you’re more of a visual and participatory learner, this is a great option for you. It’s hard to know how much space you’ll need in advance, so don’t be afraid to redo your map more neatly when you’re revising.</p><h3><strong>The charting note-taking method</strong></h3><p>This <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/note-taking/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw94WZBhDtARIsAKxWG-9WsNCSXda7viRectmhcSaL4pnvO0C4BkZdM845dZrzvDUBItw9AQwaAlHKEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">comes from Grammarly</a>, and is best employed when you’re dealing with multiple topics. Use it to compare two ideas or break idea one down into multiple parts, like pros and cons.</p><p>Divide your page into two (or more) columns and label each column to match what you’re hearing, whether that involves a comparison or a breakdown. Whenever you hear a pertinent fact related to one of your labels, stick it into the appropriate column.</p><h3><strong>The SQ3R note-taking method</strong></h3><p>The SQ3R method is one of our favorites, but it’s only for when you’re reading or studying on your own and need to take notes. The acronym breaks down like this:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Survey:</strong> Taking three to five minutes to skim your reading, writing down major headings, subheadings, topics, and points (like you would with the outlining method)</p></li><li><p><strong>Question</strong>s: Write down any questions you have about the content after briefly surveying it</p></li><li><p><strong>Read: </strong>Actually read the text, bit by bit, and keep an eye out for the answers to the questions you just wrote down</p></li><li><p><strong>Recite: </strong>After each chunk of text, write down the major ideas, keywords, and concepts, plus any answers to your questions</p></li><li><p><strong>Review: </strong>Reread your notes when you’re done, which will help you retain what you wrote down</p></li></ul><p>This technique is especially useful for helping you pick out key concepts and read critically and thoroughly to find the answers to your questions. Writing it all down helps you stay on-track and gives you solid notes to look back on in future studying sessions.</p><h2></h2><p></p><p></p><p>Lindsey Ellefson is Lifehacker’s Features Editor.

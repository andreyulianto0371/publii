The question is, which ones are actually worth your time? And how much do they cost? Here are some of the best ones by topic, plus their pricing plans.</p><h2 id="all-around-coursera">All-around: Coursera</h2><p>Coursera has an excellent reputation in this niche industry. There are thousands of class options and some of them are free, but Coursera Plus offers over 7,000 classes, projects, and certificate programs for $399 per year or $59 per month (after a week-long free trial). The courses come from companies like Google and universities like Duke and you can learn about cybersecurity analysis, IT support, HR for people managers, and much, much more.</p><h2 id="runner-up-alison">Runner up: Alison</h2><p>The courses on Alison are free, which is a big plus, and you can earn diplomas or certificates in subjects ranging from management to information technology to health. You’ll end up paying if you want a digital or printed certificate (between about $21 to $126, depending on what it is and if you want it framed), or if you want ads removed for the month (about $9). The platform allows you to create a learning plan based on your goals, whether they include upskilling or switching careers entirely, and a lot of the classes are hyper-specific, like those in bloodborne pathogens or hydrogen sulfide awareness. You can sort by career track to rack up classes that are most relevant to what you want to do. Be advised, however, that it’s not U.S. based, and not all Alison courses are accredited. Many are certified in the U.K. and recognized internationally, including some in the United States.</p><h2 id="for-entering-a-new-job-360training">For entering a new job: 360training</h2><p>360training is geared toward training you for a new job—as soon as you open the site, a pop-up window asks you what industry you’re interested in. Construction, restaurants, and real estate are the most popular options. You’ll learn the basics like compliance and safety through courses that are individually priced. For instance, HIPAA for Business Associates and HIPAA for Dental Offices are $28.99, while a 10-hour OSHA class is $59 and a 30-hour OSHA class is $159.</p><h2 id="for-creative-industries-creativelive">For creative industries: CreativeLive</h2><p>If you want to take courses in photography, videography, design, or audio engineering, try CreativeLive. Courses are individually priced, so you can pay, for instance, $49 for an intro to Apple Logic Pro, $24 to learn how to market your work on Instagram, or $99 for a complete guide to Adobe Lightroom Classic CC. There are a few free classes, too, like one about how to select your first DSLR camera.</p><h2 id="to-build-a-coding-portfolio-skillcrush">To build a coding portfolio: Skillcrush</h2><p>If you want to build a portfolio of your tech and coding work, try Skillcrush. It costs $2499 (or 12 monthly payments of $229) and you get courses in HTML and CSS, Git and GitHub, visual design, and more. The classes are project-based, so you end up with a portfolio at the end. There’s also coaching on resume building and LinkedIn management, plus guidance on searching for a job, preparing for an interview, and taking your necessary technical tests.</p><h2 id="to-upskill-in-coding-codeacademy">To upskill in coding: Codeacademy</h2><p>Whether you want to switch careers to focus on software programming and data science or you’re already in the field, Codeacademy is a good option. Before you start, you take a quiz to figure out what you already know—and don’t need to relearn. Then you get custom-matched with materials to help you better grasp everything from C++ to Python. The basic package is free, but for $34.99 a month, you can work on real-world projects and take quizzes. For $59.99 per month, you can earn professional certifications, access career services, and more.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Lindsey Ellefson is Lifehacker’s Features Editor.

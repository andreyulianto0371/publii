This year’s sale will take place October 10–11, and the mega-retailer is not only providing the illusion it is cutting prices on thousands of products (that you probably don’t need), it’s also offering free money (in the form of credits that can only be spent on Amazon). You can grab $30 of Amazon’s money if you jump through the following digital hoops.</p><h2 id="get-15-for-uploading-a-picture-to-amazon-photos">Get $15 for uploading a picture to Amazon Photos</h2><p>If you download any pictures to Amazon’s app, they’ll give you $15 in Amazon-money. Here’s how to do it:</p><ul><li><p>Download the Amazon Photo App. It’s available for iOS, Android, and desktop.</p></li><li><p>Upload at least one photo. Could be a photo of anything.</p></li></ul><p>This won’t work if you’ve used the app before. Also: It won’t work if you’re on Prime’s 7-day free trial period. The credit you receive has to be used during Prime Day—between midnight PT (3 a.m. ET) on Oct. 10 and 11:59 p.m. PT on Oct. 11 (2:59 a.m. ET on Oct. 12)— and it can only be used on an order of $30 or more.</p><h2 id="add-100-to-a-gift-card-balance-for-10-in-credit">Add $100 to a gift card balance for $10 in credit</h2><p>Eligible Amazon users can get $10 for “reloading” at least $100 onto an Amazon gift card. This only applies if you’re an Amazon Prime member using the reload feature for the first time. You can check to see if you’re eligible for the offer by clicking this link.</p><h2 id="get-5-free-for-adding-a-credit-card-to-your-amazon-wallet">Get $5 free for adding a credit card to your Amazon wallet</h2><p>If you add a new card to your Amazon wallet, the company will give you $5 in credit to spend during Prime Big Deal Days. It has to be a Visa, American Express, or Discover credit car, or a debit card. Not everyone is eligible, though. Click this link to see if you are one of the lucky ones.</p><h2 id="discounted-prime-membership-for-students-and-others">Discounted Prime Membership for students and others</h2><p>Amazon Prime membership gives you free shipping on many Amazon items and access to Prime Video’s vast selection of movies and TV shows for $14.99 and month or $139 per year (worth it for the selection of mid 1960s Beach Party movies alone.) But if you’re an eligible student or receive EBT or other government benefits, Prime will only cost you $7.49 or $6.99, respectively. Definitely take advantage if you qualify.</p><h2 id="you-can-already-shop-for-some-of-amazons-fall-prime-days-best-deals">You can already shop for some of Amazon’s Fall Prime Days best deals</h2><p>Some items are already marked down tremendously on Amazon in advance of Prime Big Deal Days, like up to half off Amazon Fire tablets and 70% off Echo smart speakers, or these “Invite Only” deals.</p><p>Lifehacker will be covering everything related to Prime Big Deal Days, so keep watch and stay alert.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Stephen Johnson is a Staff Writer for Lifehacker where he covers pop culture, including two weekly columns “The Out of Touch Adults’ Guide to Kid Culture” and “What People are Getting Wrong this Week.” He graduated from Emerson College with a BFA in Writing, Literature, and Publishing.</p><p>Previously, Stephen was Managing Editor at NBC/Universal’s G4TV.

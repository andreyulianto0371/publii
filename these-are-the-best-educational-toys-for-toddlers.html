There are ways to foster social-emotional skills at home, but playtime is one of the best ways to activate their gross and fine motor skills and help them begin to understand the world around them. As researchers continue to learn how to boost learning at a young age, toymakers continue to create products to increase their brain power and teach them to communicate with others.</p><p>Here are some of the best (and best-reviewed) educational toys available for toddlers to stimulate their learning and give them a head start.</p><h2 id="magnetic-blocks">Magnetic blocks</h2><p>Toddlers love Magna-Tiles. They’re also expensive and easily break underneath an adult’s foot, causing the little magnets inside the plastic housing to pose a choking hazard. The manufacturer of this affordable version of the popular building toy assures parents that the plastic housing is stronger and more secure than its competitors, yet is compatible with any sets they may already have.</p><h2 id="leapfrog-dinos-delightful-day-alphabet-book">LeapFrog Dino’s Delightful Day alphabet book</h2><p>My boys became obsessed with dinosaurs when they were toddlers, which makes me wish I had known about this toy sooner. It’s a complete 16-page story filled with sounds and words that introduce your kids to the alphabet. If your child isn’t in the mood for the book, they can enjoy other interactive elements, including buttons they can press to play songs or learn numbers.</p><h2 id="play-food-set">Play food set</h2><p>Children always want to help in the kitchen, but it can be a dangerous place for them to navigate when they’re little. This safe and colorful set of play food gives toddlers a sense of the journey their food makes from farm to table, ways to prepare their favorite meal, and how to handle knives properly. (Plus, the bananas actually peel!)</p><h2 id="stem-dinosaur-toys">STEM dinosaur toys</h2><p>As any parent knows, stepping on a LEGO brick hurts like hell. These toys allow kids to build something without the pain of a stray block underfoot. Children can use a battery-powered “drill” or a screwdriver to build their favorite dinosaur or even create a new beast that would make the scientists at Jurrasic World jealous. My boys received this as a gift several years ago, and they could hone their motor skills to put these together on their own.</p><h2 id="lcd-writing-tablet">LCD writing tablet</h2><p>Using a drawing app on your tablet or phone can be fun for your child, but prolonged use poses <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.mykidsvision.org/knowledge-centre/screen-time-for-babies-and-toddlers-what-is-ok#how-can-screens-affect-my-baby-or-toddler%E2%80%99s-eye-development?" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">some serious risks</a> to their developing visual system. This erasable drawing pad is safe for your child’s eyes, allowing them to create their next artistic masterpiece. Then, they can press the button on the bottom to start over and try again.</p><h2 id="musical-toy-bus">Musical toy bus</h2><p>There’s a big difference between singing “The Wheels on the Bus” and actually moving the wheels on a bus. This toy also drives independently, encouraging your toddler to move around to catch it. There are also vehicle sounds and lights, colorful animal shapes to arrange and play with, and a mode that helps kids learn.</p><h2 id="inno-pad">INNO Pad</h2><p>Much like the electronic toys from the ‘80s, this tablet uses removable cards and sounds to help children learn about shapes and animals, and learn how to tell time. Some reviews point out that younger kids can also enjoy it with assistance from a parent.</p><h2 id="musical-piano-mat">Musical piano mat</h2><p>Your toddler probably hasn’t seen Big yet, but you can recreate the best scene from the movie every day with this durable, colorful piano mat. It plays different instrument sounds, helps your child learn about music, and keeps them active as you repeatedly play “Heart and Soul.” You can also adjust the volume for when your child embarks on a solo career.</p><h2 id="playfoam">Playfoam</h2><p>This alternative to Kinetic Sand allows your kid to squeeze a safe, long-lasting material into various shapes and objects. It’s also easy to clean up, making it superior to the messy slime their aunt got them for their birthday.</p><h2 id="care-for-me-learning-carrier">Care for Me Learning Carrier</h2><p>Does your toddler want a puppy? Before heading to the adoption agency, check out this adorable toy version. It comes with everything your child needs to feed and care for it, and the pet carrier introduces them to colors, shapes, letters, and fun songs and sounds.</p><h2 id="the-best-educational-toys-for-toddlers">The best educational toys for toddlers:</h2><ul><li><p>Magnetic blocks ($19.99)</p></li><li><p>LeapFrog Dino’s Delightful Day alphabet book  ($24.99)</p></li><li><p>Play food set ($22.98)</p></li><li><p>Stem dinosaur toys ($20.99)</p></li><li><p>LCD writing tablet ($13.99)</p></li><li><p>Musical toy bus  ($19.97)</p></li><li><p>INNO Pad ($33.98)</p></li><li><p>Musical piano mat ($17.99)</p></li><li><p>Playfoam ($8.95)</p></li><li><p>Care for Me Learning Carrier ($19)</p></li></ul><p></p><p>Jason Keil is a writer, editor, and podcaster based in Phoenix, Arizona.

While the update does follow in the footsteps of Apple’s iOS 17 by offering a modest upgrade over last year’s Android 13, Android 14 has plenty of great new features and improvements on offer—enough that, if you’re running an Android phone that supports it, I highly recommend an immediate upgrade.</p><h2 id="google-brings-ai-to-android-mostly-in-future-feature-drops">Google brings AI to Android (mostly in future Feature Drops)</h2><p>One of the biggest things Google is doing with Android 14 is introducing more AI. Google has been working hard to make its generative AI systems as powerful as ChatGPT and other platforms, and while it isn’t quite there yet, the company has put a lot of faith in AI to help make Android 14 stand out.</p><p>Some of the newest AI features include the option to create a unique wallpaper using generative AI, which relies heavily on text-to-image diffusion models to create a wallpaper based on your input. It isn’t out just yet, and it’s slated to arrive first on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. (There’s a demo <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-android-features-generative-ai/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">available on Google’s blog</a>, and so far it seems really promising.)</p><p>Another big change is the AI-powered Assistant At a Glance. Google shared plans to update its Assistant widget not that long ago, allowing it to better provide information on your home screen, including precise weather forecasts, dynamic travel updates, and even reminders about upcoming events. The At a Glance widget has been sorely under-appreciated by Google in the past, so it’s nice to see them focusing more on it in ongoing updates to the Android ecosystem. (This update isn’t locked to Android 14, but it does fit into the new AI features that Google is pushing, so it seems worth mentioning.)</p><p>Google is also relying more on AI to help power some of its newest camera features, many of which will debut on the new Pixel devices.</p><h2 id="use-your-phone-as-a-webcam-plus-better-customization">Use your phone as a webcam, plus better customization</h2><p>One big feature Android is now adopting natively in Android 14 is the ability to use your phone as a plug-and-play webcam, removing the necessity to have a separate webcam for your computer. iPhones have had this feature for a while now, but that doesn’t change how helpful it should be to Android users going forward. While testing it, I found it was easy to get things connected, and my Android phone’s camera offered great video quality during the call I tested it on.</p><p>Customization is another big function that Google is expanding in Android 14, including increased options to personalize your lock screen. You can now select widgets and even control which shortcuts you use from your lock screen. This is something that some versions of Android phones have offered in the past, but the first time Android will offer it natively in the operating system. It’s a nice change, and being able to customize your lock screen more fully is a welcome addition that many users are going to have fun tinkering with.</p><p>Google has also added the option to make your entire theme monochrome, which definitely sets a vibe if you’re going for a stylish look.</p><h2 id="better-security-more-privacy">Better security, more privacy</h2><p>I’m excited to see Google focusing on onboard security on-device. Google also touts enhanced security in its operating system, but now the company is taking steps that put user privacy first, starting with better protecting your health and fitness data.</p><p>Android 14 makes it easier than ever to sync up your health and fitness data from various apps into one place. Google has also improved how it handles this data: Now, no one, not even Google will have access to the data that is tied to your private health and fitness information, which will be stored only on your device. It’s a huge leap forward, and honestly almost makes Android 14 worth upgrading to all on its own. The feature is made possible thanks to Health Connect, which you can set up in the Settings area on your Android 14 device.</p><p>Another big security change is how Android 14 handles on-screen pin codes. Previously, Android devices required a four-digit PIN, with a press of the “enter” button to confirm. Now, Android 14 will recommend a 6-digit PIN to unlock your phone, which is a much more secure standard. Furthermore, you no longer have to hit enter, which means unlocking your phone is going to be a little bit easier overall. You’ll no longer think you typed your PIN in correctly, only to find something was wrong when you hit enter.</p><p>Android 14 also provides more in-depth and easy-to-understand information about app’s data permissions, something that has been growing more and more important as malicious apps continue to pop up on the App Store and third-party websites. It’s a handy way to see why an app wants your data, and exactly what data it wants, and another key reason to update.</p><h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2><p>Finally, Google is giving Android a huge accessibility facelift with Android 14, starting with the ability to set various magnification preferences across different apps. You can change the magnifier size at any time by pinching and zooming in on the app you want to change it for. This is handy if some apps have harder-to-read text, or if you just need to read something quickly without putting on your reading glasses.</p><p>Additionally, Google has updated how texts scales when you increase the font. You’ll have more readable text when scaling the font up, which should help with those longer messages or bits of information you need to read. Scale has always been an issue on smartphones, especially when trying to increase font sizes dramatically, so this is a nice feature people with low vision should find especially useful.</p><p>Speaking of changing font sizes, you no longer have to go out of your way to do that in Android 14, as Google has added an option to adjust your font directly from the Quick Settings menu. This is another great change for low vision users, and one I’ve already found myself taking advantage of, simply because some fonts look better when smaller or larger, depending on what I’m trying to read.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most controversial additions is the appearance of flash notifications. Flash notifications are exactly what they sound like: Whenever you receive a notification, the flash on your device will go off, shining a bright light to alert you to a message or app. It can be useful, especially for those who can’t rely on auditory alerts, but it can get annoying if you get a ton of notifications. Still, it’s surprising that it has taken Google this long to add the feature.</p><h2 id="the-bigger-picture">The bigger picture</h2><p>Overall, Android 14 feels like a solid update to Google’s operating system. There are no mind-blowing new features, and many of the coolest ones aren’t available just yet. But Google is doing a lot of things right, and it really shows how much the company is progressing towards its goal of making Android a complete and fully user-supportive operating system.</p><h2 id="the-bottom-line-upgrade-to-android-14-asap">The bottom line: Upgrade to Android 14 ASAP</h2><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Performance feels smoother</p></li><li><p>Security updates are fantastic</p></li><li><p>New customization options are great</p></li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Some exciting features don’t have a release window yet</p></li><li><p>Nothing that makes Android feel hugely different than it already does</p></li></ul><p></p><p>Josh Hawkins has been writing about science, gaming, and tech culture for over a decade.

This sounds like it’s really upsetting you and hurting you deeply—especially because it’s coming from a friend. It takes a lot of courage to admit what’s going on. I’m here for you. Would you like my advice, or would you like me to simply listen and support you quietly?”</p><p>If you want to help them approach the friend, say this: “If someone—a friend or otherwise—is stripping you of your dignity, making you feel small, or telling you that you don’t matter, you deserve to be heard. It takes courage—and I know you can do it! You’re more powerful than you think. Let’s talk about how you might approach your friend.”</p><p>If your child wants you to get involved, say this: “You can always count on me. How can I best help? Would you like me to contact ______’s parents or call a meeting with the teacher or principal so we can talk to them together? Or something else?”</p><h2 id="how-to-get-involved">How to get involved</h2><p>In some cases, kids are able to resolve bullying on their own, but often, parental intervention is necessary.</p><p>“Of course, if the situation is impacting their mental or physical health, and they are unable to get themselves out of it, a parent may need to speak up,” Silverman said. “Instead of coming in aggressively, you may want to call a meeting with a teacher or guidance counselor, alongside your child, so your child can let them know what’s happening.”</p><p>Tell your child, “You are not alone. I am here and I will help you. Would you like me to come with you to talk to your guidance counselor or would you prefer to talk to her alone? How can I be the most helpful to you?”</p><p>Keep the intervention collaborative and involve your child in every step.</p><p>“I don’t feel that you should be speaking to the school or another parent ‘on the sly’ but rather, let your child know about your concerns and make a plan together to solve it,” Silverman said.</p><h2 id="dont-forget-to-follow-up">Don’t forget to follow up</h2><p>Bullying is not likely to resolve after one intervention, so check in with your child to see how it’s going.</p><p>“Please note that one of the biggest fears for kids about speaking up is that speaking up will make things worse. This is usually because adults will get involved in the beginning but then don’t follow up—and the child is left to fend for themselves when the other person is furious! It’s important for adults to check back in,” Silverman said.</p><p>Ask your child, “How are things going? Has the situation gotten better? The same?”</p><p>“Even if you aren’t the right person to help,” Silverman said, “it’s important to get your child to the right person who can help them. In other words, be the bridge to the right person.”</p><p></p><p>Anna Lee Beyer writes about mental health, relationships, parenting, and books for Huffington Post, Romper, Slate, Glamour, Parents, and others.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-to-do-when-your-child-is-being-bullied-1850781104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><b>Source: lifehacker.com</b></a></p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on January 3, 2025</div><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/authors/andre-yulianto/" title="Andre Yulianto">Andre Yulianto</a></h4></div></div><nav class="content__nav box"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/how-to-get-rid-of-old-furniture.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>How to Get Rid of Old Furniture</h5></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/how-to-get-rid-of-old-furniture.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>How to Get Rid of Old Furniture</h5></div></a></div></nav><div class="content__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related-wrap"><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/5-factors-when-selecting-your-voice-over-talent-for-maximum-impact-or-martech-zone.html" class="inverse">5 Factors When Selecting Your Voice-Over Talent For Maximum Impact | Martech Zone</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-05T03:46" class="u-small">January 5, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/21-ways-to-build-and-grow-your-email-list-or-martech-zone.html" class="inverse">21 Ways To Build And Grow Your Email List | Martech Zone</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-05T04:46" class="u-small">January 5, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/everything-you-need-to-consider-before-having-another-child.html" class="inverse">Everything You Need to Consider Before Having Another Child</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-04T22:18" class="u-small">January 4, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/authors/andre-yulianto/" class="authors__title">Andre Yulianto</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 633</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="newsletter box box--gray"><h3 class="box__title">Newsletter</h3><p class="newsletter__description">Sign up to receive email updates and to hear what's going on with us!</p><form>...</form></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/tags/blog/">blog</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li><li><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/tags/lorem-ipsum/">lorem ipsum</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/">Go Blog</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

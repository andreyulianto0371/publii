Below are six methods of opening a coconut, ranging in complexity from basically smashing it against something sharp, to breaking out the power tools and getting surgical.</p><h2 id="how-to-crack-open-a-coconut-without-any-tools">How to crack open a coconut without any tools</h2><p>You don’t need anything but a hard, pointed surface and some courage to open a fresh coconut, and, if you do it right, you won’t even lose the coconut water.</p><ul><li><p>First, find the “face” of the coconut, or the three dark spots that somewhat resemble two eyes and a mouth.</p></li><li><p>Follow the line between the eyes halfway down the side of the coconut. That line is where you want to strike it against a sharp rock or other hard object.</p></li><li><p>Hold the coconut so the line is perpendicular to the sharp edge of the rock/curb, then give it a good smash.</p></li></ul><p>You should get a cleanish break along the center of the coconut that you can pry into. A little water might spill out, but if you’re quick enough you can still save most of it when you peel open the coconut.</p><h2 id="how-to-open-a-coconut-with-tools">How to open a coconut with tools</h2><p>It’s possible to open a coconut with no tools at all, but unless you’re shipwrecked or something, using around-the-house implements will make opening that ‘nut easier and classier than the “just smash it against something” method.</p><h2 id="how-to-drain-a-coconut-with-a-screwdriver-and-hammer">How to drain a coconut with a screwdriver and hammer</h2><p>It’s easier to open a coconut if you drain it of coconut water first. Here’s how to do that.</p><ul><li><p>Locate the “eyes.” These are the weakest point in the coconut’s shell.</p></li><li><p>Poke a hole into an eye by driving in a screwdriver or nail with a hammer.</p></li><li><p>Pour out the coconut water.</p></li><li><p>If you have a drill, you can drill a hole into your coconut anywhere.</p></li></ul><h2 id="how-to-open-a-coconut-with-a-hammer">How to open a coconut with a hammer</h2><p>Now that your coconut is empty of water, it should be easy to open.</p><ul><li><p>Put the coconut in a cloth bag of some kind to keep it from moving.</p></li><li><p>Tap the coconut lightly around its “equator” with a hammer, rotating it as you go.</p></li><li><p>It should crack in half, although it won’t be that “clean” cut you need to make coconut bowls.</p></li><li><p>Alternately, if your coconut is in a cloth bag, you can just swing it around and slam it into the sidewalk, wall, or anything harder than a coconut. It’s not elegant, but it’ll open the thing.</p></li></ul><h2 id="use-your-oven-to-open-coconuts">Use your oven to open coconuts</h2><p>An easy way to open a drained coconut is to put it in the oven for a few minutes, although this will heat up the coconut’s meat.</p><ul><li><p>Set the oven to 375 or so.</p></li><li><p>Place the coconut on a cookie sheet.</p></li><li><p>Let it sit in the hot box until it starts to crack—about 15 to 20 minutes.</p></li><li><p>Let it cool.</p></li><li><p>Now you can pry the coconut open easily from the crack, or give the crack a few taps with a hammer or the back of a knife make it easier to open.</p></li></ul><h2 id="using-a-saw-to-open-a-coconut">Using a saw to open a coconut</h2><p>If you need a neat cut because you’re planning to use the coconut shell to make bowls or a culturally insensitive Halloween costume, you’ll need a saw. A kitchen knife—even one of those electric turkey carving knives—is not the right tool here.</p><p>A handsaw could work, but make sure you have a vice or another way to keep the coconut immobile while you’re sawing. The best bet for a clean coco-cut, though, is to use power tools. A jigsaw would make short work of a coconut—insert the blade into the hollow “eye” and cut it apart, turning it with your hand. You could use a reciprocating saw too, but you’d probably need a vice to keep the nut from slipping away. A bandsaw would work, if there’s enough clearance. Once you get into power tools, coconuts don’t stand a chance.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Stephen Johnson is a Staff Writer for Lifehacker where he covers pop culture, including two weekly columns “The Out of Touch Adults’ Guide to Kid Culture” and “What People are Getting Wrong this Week.” He graduated from Emerson College with a BFA in Writing, Literature, and Publishing.</p><p>Previously, Stephen was Managing Editor at NBC/Universal’s G4TV.

If you’ve been the victim of one of these confidence traps, whether it’s a romance scam, AI-assisted con job, sextortion operation, or something else, don’t assume that you’re out of luck because you’ve already paid your scammer. It might be possible for you to get the money refunded if you act quickly.</p><h2 id="how-to-get-your-money-back-if-you-sent-a-scammer-gift-cards">How to get your money back if you sent a scammer gift cards</h2><p>According to the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2023/07/if-you-paid-scammer-gift-card-your-money-gone-maybe-not?utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Federal Trade Commission</a>, some gift card companies have begun freezing fraudulent gift card funds so criminals can’t collect, and they often allowing scam victims to get their money refunded too. So if you’ve been scammed, follow these steps:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Report it to the gift card company</strong>: Call the company that issued the gift card as soon as you realize you were taken. Give them the number of the gift card, your store receipt for the purchase, and any other information they request. The sooner you can contact them, the better your chance of a refund, but report any victimizations, no matter when they happened. There’s always a chance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ask for your money back: </strong>If the funds were frozen or the scammers haven’t used it yet, you might be refunded by the card company. Although, scammers are usually pretty quick to grab their cash.</p></li><li><p><strong>Report the scam to the FTC</strong>: This might not help you get your money back, but accurate information on scams could help stop scamming as an industry.</p></li></ul><h2 id="how-to-contact-gift-card-companies-about-scams">How to contact gift card companies about scams</h2><p>Below are fraud reporting instructions for 13 major providers of gift cards.

Here’s how it works: Victims of a previous scam are contacted by what seems like a legitimate organization—the fraud team at a bank, a card company’s legal department, an organization dedicated to helping scam victims, etc.—and are asked to pay a fee or give up personal information so their scammed money can be returned.</p><p>This is either the original scammer double-dipping, or your information has been placed on a sucker-list and the sharks are circling. So don’t trust any unsolicited message from anyone saying they can recover your money. Either hang up/hit delete and forget it, or research the organization, and call them yourself instead.</p><h2 id="how-to-avoid-gift-card-scams">How to avoid gift card scams</h2><p>Scammers can be very persuasive, but there’s a simple rule to remember to avoid gift card scams: Legitimate businesses and governmental organizations don’t accept payments in gift cards. No legitimate individual can only be paid in gift cards either. So if someone scoffs at a check or a credit card payment, they are probably not on the level.</p><p>There’s a lot more to not being a victim of online scams, so check out Lifehacker’s guide to avoiding scams for more information.</p><h2 id="why-do-scammers-use-gift-cards">Why do scammers use gift cards?</h2><p>Online scammers mainly use these three instruments to separate people from their money: wire transfers from companies like Western Union, crypto currency, and gift cards. Unlike crypto currency and wire transfers, gift cards are easy for marks to buy—everyone knows there’s a whole rack of them at the supermarket.</p><p>They’re easy to drain for scammers too: Once a gift card’s numbers and PINs are given out to scammers, some cards (like Visa gift cards) are practically cash. While some card companies are taking steps to prevent fraud, gift card crime is difficult to track and prosecute. Many cards can be used internationally, and gift cards aren’t attached to an individual or account, since they’re meant to be given away, so catching grifters and holding them accountable is extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Stephen Johnson is a Staff Writer for Lifehacker where he covers pop culture, including two weekly columns “The Out of Touch Adults’ Guide to Kid Culture” and “What People are Getting Wrong this Week.” He graduated from Emerson College with a BFA in Writing, Literature, and Publishing.</p><p>Previously, Stephen was Managing Editor at NBC/Universal’s G4TV.

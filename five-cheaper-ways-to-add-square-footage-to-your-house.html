But inevitably, the longer you own it (and start filling it with stuff, pets, and children), the smaller it seems.</p><p>What’s to be done? Buy a larger home? Sure, but that’s going to be expensive, especially right now. Get a storage unit? Now your stuff is 20 minutes away, and you have a new monthly bill to pay. Add an addition to your existing house? Also expensive—but it doesn’t have to be. While adding a whole new room or wing to your house might be the ideal solution to your space needs, if you don’t have the cash for such a project, there are lower-cost options you could consider.</p><h2 id="finishing-an-existing-unfinished-space">Finishing an existing unfinished space</h2><p>The first option to consider is finishing the spaces that already exist. Unfinished areas like basements don’t count as livable space in your house, so finishing them adds value and space to your home.</p><p>If you have a garage, that’s going to be the cheapest space to finish. Garages are often already attached to the main level of the house, have a door connection to the rest of the space, and are probably wired up with electricity at the least. The average cost of converting a garage is <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.bobvila.com/articles/garage-conversion-cost/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">around $15,000</a>, though it can go a lot higher if you need to add plumbing for a bathroom or if your garage is very large (or if you’re trying to convert one portion of a 3-car garage and keeping the rest for a car). The main downside is the loss of covered parking, but this is a cheap way to gain square footage.</p><p>Unfinished attics and basements are also obvious targets for finishing, with the cost to finish a basement <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/foundation/cost-to-finish-basement/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">averaging about $23,000</a> and the cost of finishing an attic <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.bobvila.com/articles/cost-to-finish-attic/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">averaging $25,000</a>.</p><h2 id="enclose-an-outdoor-space">Enclose an outdoor space</h2><p>Another way to add square footage to your home cheaply is to take advantage of outdoor spaces that are already part of the home’s footprint, like patios and porches. This can be pretty involved, requiring new foundations and everything from plumbing to wiring in addition to adding walls, windows, and doors connecting the space to the existing home. Depending on the size of your patio, completely enclosing it can run you anywhere <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://homeguide.com/costs/patio-enclosures-cost" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">from $17,500 on the low end</a> to several hundred grand on the higher end—which isn’t much cheaper than just adding a room. Enclosing a porch and making it into a four-season room can be cheaper, ranging from <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.bankrate.com/homeownership/cost-to-enclose-porch/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">$20,000 to $80,000 on average</a>.</p><p>A cheaper option for a porch or patio conversion is to create a sunroom or three-season room. Because these spaces lack insulation and heating, they’re generally cheaper to build (screening in a patio, for example, can be as cheap as $500, and a three-season porch can often be obtained for less than $10,000). While these won’t count as official bedrooms or anything and aren’t usable in colder weather, they still add value and usable space to your home.</p><p>If you’re handy, a cheaper option for a sunroom or three-season room conversion could be a <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.patioenclosures.com/sunroom-kits.aspx" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">DIY kit</a>. These can get the job done for as <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://homeguide.com/costs/sunroom-cost" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">cheap as $1,500</a> because they don’t include labor costs, and typically require just a few days to construct.</p><h2 id="create-bump-outs-or-dormers">Create bump outs or dormers</h2><p>An affordable option to add just a little space to your home is a <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.thespruce.com/bump-outs-micro-addition-adds-room-space-1821118" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">bump-out</a> or an <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.angi.com/articles/4-things-consider-adding-dormer.htm" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">attic dormer</a>. A bump-out is a small addition to a room, sometimes as small as two feet in depth. They’re usually supported by the existing home’s foundation, so don’t require one of their own. Depending on the length of the bump-out, you can add a few dozen square feet to the living area of your house, and the costs range from $5,000 to about $32,000, depending on the size and complexity of the project.</p><p>Adding a dormer or two to your attic doesn’t actually add much square footage, but it can make the existing attic space into usable space by raising the ceiling height and adding windows. Attic dormers typically cost less than $20,000 to add, and can transform a tight attic into a sunny room.</p><h2 id="create-a-loft">Create a loft</h2><p>If the interior of your house has at least one space with soaring ceilings, you can add some usable space by building a loft area. This can be <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/interior-projects/how-to/a20881/build-an-overhead-loft-to-expand-a-small-room/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">a DIY project</a> if you really want to keep costs down, and can give you an office space or additional storage space without sacrificing any existing areas. Depending on how ambitious you are (is this just a platform for a bed, or are you envisioning a fully-equipped office?) a lofted area within a room can run you anywhere from a few grand to tens of thousands of dollars.</p><h2 id="add-a-prefab-shedadu">Add a prefab shed/ADU</h2><p>Finally, if you have backyard space, you could consider adding a <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.mightysmallhomes.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">tiny house</a> (also called an Accessory Dwelling Unit, or ADU) or <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.studio-shed.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">prefabricated shed space</a> to your property. Tiny homes can be as cheap as $4,000 if you DIY the build, and you can wire them for power and add plumbing, climate control, and nice finishes to create freestanding living space. Be sure to check with your HOA or local government concerning permits and other requirements before you click “ORDER” on an entire small house.</p><p></p><p></p><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/cheap-ways-to-add-square-footage-to-your-house-1850728905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><b>Source: lifehacker.com</b></a></p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on January 3, 2025</div><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/authors/andre-yulianto/" title="Andre Yulianto">Andre Yulianto</a></h4></div></div><nav class="content__nav box"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/evil-week-how-to-summon-a-demon.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Evil Week: How to Summon a Demon</h5></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/evil-week-how-to-summon-a-demon.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Evil Week: How to Summon a Demon</h5></div></a></div></nav><div class="content__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related-wrap"><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/21-ways-to-build-and-grow-your-email-list-or-martech-zone.html" class="inverse">21 Ways To Build And Grow Your Email List | Martech Zone</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-05T04:46" class="u-small">January 5, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/cant-rank-your-website-do-this-to-escape-the-google-purgatory.html" class="inverse">Can’t Rank Your Website?

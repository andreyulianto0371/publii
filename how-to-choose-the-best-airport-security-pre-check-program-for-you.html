There are a few different programs that can help make the process easier, though: TSA PreCheck, Global Entry, NEXUS, and CLEAR. These programs have a lot of similarities but also a few key differences. Here’s what you need to know about each one and how to decide which one is right for you.</p><h2 id="what-is-tsa-precheck">What is TSA PreCheck?</h2><p>TSA PreCheck is a program that allows low-risk travelers to go through a faster, easier security process. You start by applying online and paying a $78 application fee that is good for five years (<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.tsa.gov/precheck/faq#:~:text=Will%20the%20price%20of%20TSA%20PreCheck%C2%AE%20change%3F" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">the fee may change</a>, but many credit card companies will reimburse it). You’ll have to go to for a short interview at a TSA PreCheck enrollment center; once you’re approved, you’ll get a Known Traveler Number (KTN) to use when booking flights. When you get to the airport, you’ll be able to use the shorter and faster PreCheck lines to check your ID and go through security, and you’ll get to pass through a traditional metal detector rather the invasive full-body scanner. The best part is that you are not required to take your shoes, belts, or jackets off, and liquids and electronics can stay in your bag during screening. <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/frequently-asked-questions/i-am-traveling-my-family-can-they-also-use-tsa-precheckr-lane" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Kids and teens can also join their parents</a> in the PreCheck line.</p><p>TSA PreCheck might be the best option for most people given its low fee and time savings at the security screening. There are no benefits for international travel, though.</p><h2 id="what-is-global-entry">What is Global Entry?</h2><p>Global Entry is a program that allows low-risk travelers to expedite the customs process when entering the United States. If you’re a frequent international traveler, this can be a great time-saver. The application process is similar to TSA PreCheck—you’ll need to fill out an online application and pay the $100 application fee (many credit cards will reimburse this fee). You’ll receive a conditional approval and need to go to a Global Entry office to finish your application with an interview (many office locations are at the airport). Once you’re approved, you’ll get a KTN, which you can use when booking flights. When you arrive in the United States, you’ll be able to use the Global Entry line at customs, which is usually shorter and faster than the regular line. Global Entry members also have full access to TSA PreCheck lines. Global Entry is valid for up to five years.</p><p>Global Entry might be right for you if you travel internationally often by air.</p><h2 id="what-is-nexus">What is NEXUS?</h2><p>NEXUS is a program that allows low-risk travelers to expedite the security and customs process when entering Canada and the United States. If you’re a frequent traveler to both countries, this can be a great time-saver. The application process is similar to TSA PreCheck and Global Entry—you’ll need to fill out an online application and pay the $50 application fee (a few credit cards will reimburse this fee) and then go in for an interview. Once you’re approved, you’ll get a NEXUS card, which you can use when entering both countries. When you arrive in either country, you’ll be able to use the NEXUS line at security and customs, which is usually shorter and faster than the regular line. NEXUS members also have full access to TSA PreCheck lines in the United States and can use the Global Entry kiosks when flying back into the U.S. NEXUS is valid for up to five years.</p><p>NEXUS might be right for you if you travel internationally often and sometimes travel over land to Canada or Mexico, or if you live close to a NEXUS application center (mostly in border states) and prefer to save the $50 compared to Global Entry.</p><h2 id="what-is-clear">What is CLEAR?</h2><p>CLEAR’s flagship program, CLEAR Plus, allows low-risk travelers to expedite getting their ID checked when entering airports and stadiums. You’ll need to fill out an online application and pay a $189 annual fee (a few credit cards will reimburse this fee). Once you’re approved, you’ll need to finish your CLEAR setup at the airport. When you arrive at the airport, you’ll be able to use the CLEAR line instead of the TSA or PreCheck line, and check yourself in with a self-service kiosk that uses biometric data (fingerprints and eye scans) to verify your ID and boarding pass. Once this is done, you’ll be escorted to the back of the security line where your bags are checked and your body is scanned.</p><p>However, be aware that changes were considered due to an undisclosed security incident in 2022 that made <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/07/12/tsa-airport-screening-clear-checkpoints/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">TSA want to increase the number of random checks</a> where CLEAR members have to show an ID to a TSA agent. That attempt <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/08/10/tsa-clear-enhanced-id-checks/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">seems to be getting pulled back</a> after pushback from CLEAR, but it is uncertain if things are likely to change in the future.</p><p>In the meantime, wait times on the CLEAR section <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-26/is-clear-or-tsa-precheck-better-travelers-wait-in-airport-security-lines" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">were already getting longer from an increasing number of members signing up</a> (10% of travelers in the participating 52 airports are reportedly now part of the program). The most appealing aspect of CLEAR has historically been skipping the line where you have your ID checked by a TSA agent; while you will still be able to skip the main ID line, wait times might get longer if the TSA does decide to make CLEAR travelers go through extra hoops. At this point, the TSA has told CLEAR it will be a smaller proportion of CLEAR members who will undergo additional identity vetting compared to what was originally planned, <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/08/10/tsa-clear-enhanced-id-checks/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">according to the Washington Post</a>.</p><p>CLEAR, unlike TSA PreCheck, does not give you any benefits once you pass the ID checkpoint and get to the security screening—you’ll be screened as thoroughly as everyone else.</p><p>CLEAR might be right for you if you fly frequently but don’t often travel internationally or over land to Canada or Mexico—and you’re able to get the service for free or heavily discounted. It is best used if you already have TSA PreCheck since you are able to benefit from both. You can also use it with Global Entry or NEXUS membership.</p><p>This post was originally published in August 2022 and was updated on July 17, 2023 to include TSA PreCheck benefits and updates on pricing, and again on August 15, 2023, with updated information regarding screenings for CLEAR members.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Daniel is a Staff Writer for Lifehacker.

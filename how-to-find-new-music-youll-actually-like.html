E.g., <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2019/08/15/best-bandcamp-jazz-july-2019/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">July’s best of jazz</a> or<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/best-reissues/the-best-reissues-on-bandcamp-september-october-2020" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"> the best recent reissues</a>. (via Maria Sherman, senior writer at Jezebel.)</p></li><li><p>You can dig deeper into Bandcamp by “tag surfing” from a band you like to others, or following <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">the Bandcamp blog</a>, says GMG developer Janos Hardi.</p></li><li><p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">SoundCloud</a> is similarly built for wandering; when you’re done with a track, it autoplays something else you might like. Find an artist you enjoy, then check out the tracks they’ve “liked.” Tag surfing works great here as well.</p></li><li><p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.pandora.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Pandora</a> might show up in Google below the jewelry brand of the same name, but it’s still one of the best “custom radio” services. Just tell it an artist you like and it builds a new station. For less obvious results, plug in a band that you’ve only recently fallen in love with.</p></li><li><p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.iheart.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">iHeartRadio</a> is also still around, streaming radio stations (both old-school and niche digital-only) based on your genre preferences—and you can listen on your favorite smart speaker.</p></li><li><p>Tools like <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.gnoosic.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Gnoosic</a> and <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.musicroamer.com/#/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Musicroamer</a> work like tiny versions of Pandora or Spotify Discover, suggesting new music based on what you enter.</p></li><li><p>Spotify and Apple Music try to alert you to new releases by artists you already like, but their delivery systems kind of suck. (Just give me a playlist, and don’t clog it up with bands I “might like,” you weirdos!) But you can fix that with services like <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://muzeroom.com/releases" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">MuzeRoom</a>, <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://muspy.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">muspy</a>, and <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://swarm.fm/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Swarm.fm</a>. They all offer different options for importing your listening history from iTunes, Spotify or <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://last.fm/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">last.fm</a>, plus options for manually entering bands to follow.</p></li><li><p>A pandemic is not the time to get your friends to gather for an in-person listening party, but you could probably coax them onto <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.jqbx.fm/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">JQBX</a>, where users synch up their Spotify playback in a virtual DJ room. You need Spotify Premium to use it, but JQBX also lets you import and export music to Spotify—plus its search function seems to work better than Spotify’s own. Lifehacker loves it.</p></li><li><p>If your workplace has a chat app, start a channel for sharing music. That’s where I got all the recommendations from my GMG colleagues.</p></li><li><p>Join <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://last.fm/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">last.fm</a>, which tracks your music listens across different platforms, and you’ll have a centralized record of your listening habits, along with recommendations. I’ve had an account for over a decade, and sometimes I dig into the archives to find forgotten favorites.</p></li><li><p>If you’re still using Facebook, join some music-based groups, or follow the pages of specific artists. Music recommendation communities can be intimidating, but Facebook has a way of making it all feel accessible.</p></li><li><p>Apple Music, as everyone knows, sucks at algorithmic music recommendation. But its staff-curated playlists are intricate and reliable. For major artists, Apple supplements its “essentials” lists with “next steps,” “deep cuts” and music that influenced or was influenced by the artist. There are even playlists of the best covers of certain artists.</p></li><li><p>Compilation streams on SoundCloud: On <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://soundcloud.com/kaptaincarbon-1/vintage-obscura-summer-mix-2014" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">“Vintage Obscura Summer Mix 2014,”</a> I found the Smiles original <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QvNXYDn5i0" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">“I Am Just a Star on a Democratic Flag,”</a>which you won’t find on Spotify or Apple Music.

Most of the concerts are 15-20 minutes, <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/no-band-should-play-for-more-than-20-minutes-1824158060" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">the correct length for a music set</a>. If there’s anything wrong with discovering music this way, it’s that everyone sounds their best behind the tiny desk.</p></li><li><p>You probably already bump into covers when you’re looking for music. Try collections of covers of your favorite artists (Spotify probably has a cover for every Beatles song), to find groups that might have a different sound, but share your love of the first artist.</p></li><li><p>“Vice News Tonight has a tragically overlooked segment called <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw613M86o5o5jd2UQnjkv_q-qhUGmOr8v" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">New Music Corner</a> in which they ask musicians to comment on new releases from other acts.

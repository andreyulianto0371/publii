They were then sued and decided to settle. Two settlementsare part of the same agreement. The first is a <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.woodardvnavient.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">$28 million settlement</a> from the claims that they forced students to repay student loans that should have been discharged after their bankruptcy. The second is a <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.navientstudentloansettlement.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">$16 million settlement</a> for compensation to those students affected by the illegal collection of payments.</p><p>If you were obligated to repay Navient private student loans, filed for bankruptcy in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court outside of Texas, Louisiana or Mississippi after Oct. 17, 2005, and obtained a discharge order, then you’re eligible for the $28 million settlement. If you’re a borrower (0r co-borrower) who filed for bankruptcy protection after Oct. 17, 2005, and never reaffirmed your private student loans, then you’re eligible for the $16 million settlement.</p><p>There is no set award amount for the first settlement; it will depend on the type of damages students experienced, as well as other factors. Navient agreed to let go of the collection of certain student loans as well as help restore damage to the credit reports of those impacted. The second settlement will pay 20% to 100% of the damages suffered, including student loan payments made after Navient’s bankruptcy.</p><p>The first <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://secure.woodardvnavient.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">settlement must be filed</a> by Nov. 13, 2023, and the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://secure.navientstudentloansettlement.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">second</a> by Nov. 20, 2023.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Daniel is a Staff Writer for Lifehacker.

It’s nearly identical to the Logitech G502 that preceded it, though some notable features are missing from the design. If you’re already sold on the style and design of the Logitech G502 series, then the G502 X Plus is a no-brainer. But if you’re just looking at this mouse among dozens of other possible options, the picture isn’t quite as clear.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong: I love everything about the Logitech G502 X Plus. My only gripes are the somewhat clunky-sounding switches, and the fact Logitech has done away with the tuning weights seen in previous G502 variants. The lack of tuning weights takes away from the enthusiast level these gaming mice used to approach. Those negatives aside, there’s a lot to love about this mouse.</p><h2 id="design-and-usability">Design and usability</h2><p></p><figure class="border border-gray-100"><img src="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699835057.png" alt="Lifehacker Image" width="2000" height="1126" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GR9M2NCJVJM1WDFH4D9TC/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1699835057.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GR9M2NCJVJM1WDFH4D9TC/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1699835057.png 1400w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699835057.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/responsive/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699835057-xs.png 300w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/responsive/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699835057-sm.png 480w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/responsive/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699835057-md.png 768w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/responsive/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699835057-lg.png 1024w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/responsive/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699835057-xl.png 1360w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/responsive/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699835057-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>Credit: Logitech</p><p>If you’ve ever searched for a gaming mouse, you’ll know the design of the device plays a vital part in just how usable it will be. In fact, there are a few important types of grip which you can use to help determine whether a mouse will be comfortable or not. When it comes to the Logitech G502 X Plus, those who typically use a Palm, Claw, or Fingertip grip will find it the most comfortable to use, especially for longer periods of time.</p><p>Thanks to its spaceship-like design, the mouse sports a somewhat futuristic look. This design allows for an ergonomic mouse that you’ll likely be happy to use, once you get used to the button layout. The thumb rest on the mouse is well-situated, allowing for a nice, comfortable spot to rest your thumb during use. It’s also close to the only detachable button on the device, which you can remove if you don’t plan to use it.</p><p>Overall, the design of the Logitech G502 X Plus isn’t anything to rave about. It’s your typical-looking gaming mouse, with the addition of the RGB that has become so beloved in the gaming community in recent years. The addition of DPI buttons to the left of the left-mouse button makes it easy to quickly change between different DPIs, something I’ve always loved to see in a gaming mouse.</p><p>Another big part of the usability comes with the profiles you can make use of in the Logitech G Hub application. This allows you to change button combinations based solely on which application you’re using, handy if you frequently swap between FPS and MMOs with their different needs. You can easily set up these profiles in Logitech G Hub, but two buttons located just below the middle-mouse button let you quickly swap between your preset profiles on the fly.</p><p>The Logitech G502 X Plus is designed as both a wired and wireless gaming mouse, and you can easily disconnect the included charging cable and connect it to the wireless receiver. It’s a reliable and strong connection, and I never noticed any kind of delay between my interactions when running intense games like Cyberpunk 2077, Starfield, and Red Dead Redemption 2, or while browsing or working with it.</p><p>The mouse is also exceptionally easy to use on wired mode: The cord is lightweight and long enough to move around without worrying about running out of cable.</p><h2 id="battery-life">Battery life</h2><p></p><figure class="border border-gray-100"><img src="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/images-2.fill.size_2000x1169.v1699835057.jpg" alt="Lifehacker Image" width="2000" height="1169" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GR9M2NCJVJM1WDFH4D9TC/images-2.fill.size_800x468.v1699835057.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GR9M2NCJVJM1WDFH4D9TC/images-2.fill.size_1400x818.v1699835057.jpg 1400w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/images-2.fill.size_2000x1169.v1699835057.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/responsive/images-2.fill.size_2000x1169.v1699835057-xs.jpg 300w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/responsive/images-2.fill.size_2000x1169.v1699835057-sm.jpg 480w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/responsive/images-2.fill.size_2000x1169.v1699835057-md.jpg 768w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/responsive/images-2.fill.size_2000x1169.v1699835057-lg.jpg 1024w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/responsive/images-2.fill.size_2000x1169.v1699835057-xl.jpg 1360w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/229/responsive/images-2.fill.size_2000x1169.v1699835057-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p>Credit: Logitech</p><p>If you plan on using the Logitech G502 X Plus as a wireless gaming mouse, you have two options. First, you can use it with the wireless receiver that comes in the package. This USB receiver can connect to your computer directly or via a connector point that comes in the box. This makes charging the device easy: You just need to remove the cable from the connector and plug it into the mouse. Based on Logitech’s claims, the battery in the G502 X Plus will last up to 140 hours. I tended to charge it every two to three days, depending on how much I used it. Of course, you can change the length of time the battery lasts by messing around with the sleep controls inside the Logitech G Hub, disabling RGB on the mouse, or even by turning off the mouse via the power switch on the bottom.</p><p>The other alternative you have to the standard USB receiver is to pick up the Logitech PowerPlay wireless mousepad, which charges your G502 X Plus without plugging it in. It does this by replacing the standard core in your mouse with the “Powercore” module, which is easy to do. This causes the mouse to charge constantly when on the pad—or at least when it falls below 85-95 percent of the battery.</p><p>The PowerPlay wireless mousepad also acts as a wireless receiver for your G502 X Plus, which means it’ll take up a single USB port on your PC. The material that Logitech uses on the PowerPlay is soft and feels smooth against the bottom of the mouse. Compared to the standard leather pad I use (which covers my entire desktop to help protect it), the PowerPlay pad actually felt more reliable and smoother to work and game off of.</p><h2 id="the-plus-and-minus-of-it-all">The plus and minus of it all</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The Logitech G502 X Plus is a solid gaming mouse, but if you aren’t convinced you should splurge on the most expensive offering that Logitech has right now, there are always other variants of the G502 X lineup to take advantage of. Ultimately, though, this is one of the best mice you’ll find from Logitech, and for good reason.</p><p>The performance here is incredible, offering lightning-fast response times that I’m thrilled with whether I’m playing an intense FPS game, exploring a random planet in Starfield, or just browsing the internet. The comfort of the mouse is another high point, and the fact that it offers comfortable use for multiple grip styles is a huge win for gamers everywhere.</p><p>It’s also easy to set up, and customizing the buttons and profiles is a breeze. You can, of course, tinker around with the different buttons that Logitech offers on the G502 X Plus, and even disable buttons you don’t have any intention to use. Adding in the PowerPlay mousepad is another great way to improve the mouse’s overall effectiveness, as it makes charging it as easy as just using it in your day-to-day life.</p><p>The Logitech G502X Plus is a great gaming mouse despite its lacking features and somewhat clunky-sounding switches. The stellar battery life paired with the extreme useability of the mouse makes it an easy recommendation for gamers who need a mouse that does just about everything well. You can purchase the G502 X Plus on Amazon for $160.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Ergonomic design</p></li><li><p>Interchangeable thumb buttons</p></li><li><p>Excellent battery life</p></li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Clunky switches</p></li><li><p>Lacking features</p></li></ul><p></p><p>Josh Hawkins has been writing about science, gaming, and tech culture for over a decade.

And that’s just one-way, so needless to say, the costs of checking your bags adds up quick.</p><p>One of the savviest ways to avoid those checked bag fees is with airline-specific credit credits. Most offer some sort of checked baggage perks, where all you need to do is attach your frequent flyer number to your reservation to automatically redeem this benefit. And as long as you fly your airline of choice at least three times per year, the annual fee will be worth what you save in checked luggage. Here are the best credit cards that feature free checked baggage as a benefit, arranged alphabetically by airline.</p><h2 id="alaska-airlines-visa">Alaska Airlines Visa</h2><p>Annual fee: $95</p><p>When you purchase your flight with your Alaska Airlines Visa credit card, you can check a first bag for free for you and up to six additional passengers on the same reservation.</p><h2 id="citi-aadvantage-cards">Citi AAdvantage cards</h2><p>Annual fee: $99</p><p>If you fly American Airlines, Citi AAdvantage cards are one way to avoid checked bag fees. The Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select World Elite Mastercard and CitiBusiness AAdvantage Platinum Select World Mastercard both have a free checked bag benefit for you and up to four traveling companions on your reservation.</p><p>The Citi AAdvantage Executive World Elite Mastercard offers the same free checked bag benefit, but it extends to up to eight traveling companions on the same reservation.</p><h2 id="barclays-aviator-cards">Barclays Aviator cards</h2><p>Annual fee: $95-99</p><p>Barclays cards are another option for American Airlines flyers. The AAdvantage Aviator Red World Elite Mastercard and AAdvantage Aviator Business Mastercard both offer a first bag checked free to the primary cardholder and four companions on domestic reservations.</p><p>Barclays also has the Hawaiian Airlines World Elite Mastercard, which offers not one but two free checked bags (with a $99 annual fee).</p><h2 id="delta-skymiles-cards">Delta SkyMiles cards</h2><p>Most of Delta’s credit card options come with one free checked bag for the cardholder and eight others traveling on the same itinerary, so long as you attach your Delta SkyMiles number to your reservation.</p><p>There’s a wide range in rates and fees, depending on how elite of a SkyMiles card you want. For instance, the more basic Delta SkyMiles Gold American Express Card has a $0 intro annual fee for the first year, and then the standard $99 after that. The Delta SkyMiles Reserve Business American Express Card, on the other hand, starts at a $550 annual fee. Compare your options for Delta SkyMiles cards here.</p><h3>JetBlue cards</h3><p>Annual fee: $99</p><p>The JetBlue Plus card or the JetBlue Business Card both offer a free checked bag to you and three travel companions on your reservation.</p><h2 id="united-cards">United cards</h2><p>Annual fee: $95-$99</p><p>The United Explorer Card and the United Business Card let you bring your first checked bag free for you and a companion on your reservation. You must have your MileagePlus number on your reservation and purchase your ticket with the applicable card for the perk to apply.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Meredith Dietz is Lifehacker’s Senior Finance Writer.

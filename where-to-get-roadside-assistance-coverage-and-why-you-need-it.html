Roadside assistance does the work of locating and dispatching a tow truck or service vehicle for you, which comes in handy at odd hours or in unfamiliar locations. A service call, such as a tire change or jump-start, may also cost less if made through a roadside assistance plan than one booked directly.</p><p>Here’s where to look for roadside assistance coverage.</p><h2 id="roadside-assistance-and-motor-clubs">Roadside assistance and motor clubs</h2><p>Membership clubs like AAA offer standalone roadside assistance plans <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/guides/roadside-assistance/best-roadside-assistance-plans/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">at various price points and coverage levels</a>. Premium plans usually include longer towing distances and additional perks compared to basic options. You can expect to pay anywhere from around $60 to $130 per year for a plan from a provider like AAA, AARP, Good Sam, or Better World Club.</p><h2 id="auto-insurers">Auto insurers</h2><p>Roadside assistance may be an <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/guides/roadside-assistance/best-roadside-assistance-plans/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">easy add-on to your car insurance policy</a>. Most insurers provide coverage for basic benefits like towing and battery jump-starts—some have additional perks like included labor, winching, and rental car coverage. Costs range from around $12 to $60 per year on top of your policy premium. Allstate also offers a standalone plan and pay-per-use coverage, even if you aren’t an auto insurance customer.</p><h2 id="credit-card-issuers">Credit card issuers</h2><p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-credit-cards-roadside-assistance/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Certain credit cards offer roadside assistance coverage</a> as a benefit to cardholders without needing to subscribe to a separate membership such as AAA. Credit card roadside assistance perks are generally pay-per-use, and the coverage varies by card. For example, the Chase Sapphire Reserve covers up to $50 per event for up to four events per year, while Chase Freedom Unlimited cardholders pay a pre-negotiated fee for each service event.</p><h2 id="cell-phone-providers">Cell phone providers</h2><p>Like auto insurers, some telecom companies offer roadside assistance to customers as a mobile plan add-on. Verizon, for example, <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.verizon.com/support/roadside-assistance-faqs/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">charges $4.99 per line</a> per month and allows four service claims per year. However, while short-distance towing is included at no charge, other services, such as a tire change or jump start, cost nearly $100 per incident. T-Mobile <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/benefits/aaa-membership-deal" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">offers eligible customers a one-year AAA membership</a>.</p><p>Apple also recently announced that its Emergency SOS feature now allows users to obtain AAA roadside assistance via satellite. While this feature is free for two years upon activation, the services provided are pay-per-use unless you have a AAA membership.</p><h2 id="car-manufacturers">Car manufacturers</h2><p>Some car manufacturers offer roadside assistance as part of the warranty on new and certified pre-owned vehicles, so ask about this benefit if you’re purchasing from a dealer. Extended warranties from companies like Carchex and CarShield also include roadside assistance coverage.</p><h2 id="questions-to-ask-when-choosing-a-roadside-assistance-plan">Questions to ask when choosing a roadside assistance plan</h2><p>The first thing to consider when shopping for roadside assistance is what services are included. Plans typically cover towing, lockouts, jump-starts, tire changes, and fuel delivery, though the specifics vary across plans, and some limit towing distances and the number of service calls allowed per year. Premium benefits include winching, trip interruption (such as reimbursement for food and lodging), replacement battery installation, and rekeying.</p><p>You should also determine whether your plan will cover services provided to additional drivers and family members as well as rental cars.</p><p>Price is another factor when shopping for roadside assistance coverage. If you have a credit card that offers pay-per-use services, you get the peace of mind for free and can simply hope you won’t need to use the benefit. Note that while an auto insurance or mobile plan add-on may be cheaper upfront, using your coverage may cost you more in the end compared to a comprehensive membership plan.</p><p></p><p>Emily is a freelance writer based in Salt Lake City, UT.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-find-roadside-assistance-1850930049" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><b>Source: lifehacker.com</b></a></p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on January 3, 2025</div><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/authors/andre-yulianto/" title="Andre Yulianto">Andre Yulianto</a></h4></div></div><nav class="content__nav box"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/donand039t-miss-these-november-class-action-settlement-deadlines.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Don&amp;#039;t Miss These November Class-Action Settlement Deadlines</h5></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/donand039t-miss-these-november-class-action-settlement-deadlines.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Don&amp;#039;t Miss These November Class-Action Settlement Deadlines</h5></div></a></div></nav><div class="content__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related-wrap"><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/7-signs-you-do-not-need-an-ad-server-or-martech-zone.html" class="inverse">7 Signs You Do Not Need An Ad Server | Martech Zone</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-10T02:59" class="u-small">January 10, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/you-need-to-run-slower.html" class="inverse">You Need to Run Slower</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-10T00:13" class="u-small">January 10, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/where-to-stream-chadwick-bosemanand039s-top-movies-online.html" class="inverse">Where to Stream Chadwick Boseman&amp;#039;s Top Movies Online</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-04T22:21" class="u-small">January 4, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/authors/andre-yulianto/" class="authors__title">Andre Yulianto</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 633</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="newsletter box box--gray"><h3 class="box__title">Newsletter</h3><p class="newsletter__description">Sign up to receive email updates and to hear what's going on with us!</p><form>...</form></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/tags/blog/">blog</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li><li><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/tags/lorem-ipsum/">lorem ipsum</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/">Go Blog</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

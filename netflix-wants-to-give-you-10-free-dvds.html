Times have changed, and the streaming company is shutting down its subscription DVD service next month after 25 years. The last discs will be mailed on Sept. 29, but Netflix is going out with a DVD party by letting customers hold onto their final shipments—and sending them up to 10 extra discs to keep forever too, but only if they opt-in to the program.</p><h2 id="how-to-get-10-free-dvds-from-netflix">How to get 10 free DVDs from Netflix</h2><p>Receiving your 10 Netflix DVDs is straightforward, but you have to have a subscription to Netflix DVD plan. Luckily, even though the service is shutting down soon, they’re still taking new members until Aug. 29.</p><ul><li><p>Navigate to <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://dvd.netflix.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Netflix DVD’s main page</a>. If you don’t have a membership, sign-up.</p></li><li><p>Login to your <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://dvd.netflix.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Netflix DVD account.</a></p></li><li><p>Make sure your queue contains at least 10 DVDs.</p></li><li><p>Existing members have already received an email with the link to Netflix’s Finale site, but if you’ve just signed up, login and navigate to <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://dvd.netflix.com/FinaleSurprise" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">dvd.netflix.com/finalesurprise</a></p></li><li><p>Congratulations, you’ve opted in! You won’t necessarily get all of the 10 latest discs in your queue, but you might. Or you you might get some of them. It’s a crap-shoot.</p></li></ul><h2 id="do-you-get-to-keep-the-dvds-netflix-sends">Do you get to keep the DVDs Netflix sends?</h2><p>Yes! While previously the company said it will “continue to accept returns until October 27th, 2023,” they don’t expect you to send these extra titles back, and won’t charge you for any discs sent out after Sept. 29—a point the company <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://twitter.com/dvdnetflix/status/1693794419659653517" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">recently clarified with a post on the social network formerly known as Twitter</a>.</p><h2 id="why-would-anyone-even-want-dvds-from-netflix">Why would anyone even want DVDs from Netflix?</h2><p>Streaming is immediate and easy, and in most other ways better than physical media, but there were some advantages to Netflix’s DVD service, particularly when it came to selection, price, and nostalgia.</p><p>Unlike its paltry selection on streaming, you could find almost anything on Netflix’s disc-rental service. It would rent you films otherwise only available as digital rentals, or streaming exclusively on another service. It was cheaper too, if you did it right: Digital rentals can cost up to $4–$6 each, and Netflix’s cheapest plan was $9 a month, so as long as you watched at least two DVDs a month, you’d have saved money.</p><h2 id="dvds-are-still-better-than-streaming-in-some-ways">DVDs are still better than streaming in some ways</h2><p>These days, the intangible benefit of Netflix DVD service is nostalgia. Back in the ‘90s, Netflix’s “we’ll send movies to your house” business plan was exciting and revolutionary. Anyone who signed up immediately understood how it would drive video stores out of business, and that was before they started streaming.</p><p>Netflix made it easy and convenient to be a cinephile. Back then, it could be hard to even find the movies you wanted to rent, particularly if your tastes were refined or lowbrow. Art movies and trash cinema alike were usually too obscure for the shelves of your local Hollywood Video or Blockbuster, but you could get both Fellini’s <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://dvd.netflix.com/Movie/Fellini-Satyricon/60010344" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Satyricon</a> and <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://dvd.netflix.com/Search?v1=Cannibal%20Ferox" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Cannibal Ferox</a> from Netflix. (You still can, at least for another month.)</p><p>Consider also that the golden age of DVD standardized cool bonus features like commentary tracks and deleted scenes. Those available-only-on-DVD alternate takes, behind-the-scenes documentaries, and other goodies were the beginning of our current, overly-media-saturated epoch. It took a few years to learn that those scenes were deleted for a reason and that commentary tracks are as likely to detract from a movie as add to it, but at the beginning, those things were extremely cool in a way that’s hard to understand if you’re used to a quick web search burying you in information about any movie or TV show you like.</p><p>Anyway, you still have a few days to sign up for Netflix’s DVD service, and a few weeks to remember the old days, or just to be around to hear the death knell of a once-ubiquitous cultural force that is quickly being forgotten. And to get your 10 free DVDs.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Stephen Johnson is a Staff Writer for Lifehacker where he covers pop culture, including two weekly columns “The Out of Touch Adults’ Guide to Kid Culture” and “What People are Getting Wrong this Week.” He graduated from Emerson College with a BFA in Writing, Literature, and Publishing.</p><p>Previously, Stephen was Managing Editor at NBC/Universal’s G4TV.

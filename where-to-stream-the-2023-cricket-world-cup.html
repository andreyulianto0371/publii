Badgers (extreme cricket fans) can watch all 48 matches from cricket’s ICC ODI World Cup from their living rooms, even if they don’t have cable TV, so there’s no excuse to miss a single yorker or golden duck.</p><p>Cricket has yet to find the level of popularity in the U.S. as it has in other nations, but the World Cup is a perfect time to dive in, learn the game, and enjoy match-ups between the Earth’s finest cricket squads, including a grudge match between the current world champions, England’s Three Lions, and their hated rivals, Pakistan’s Men in Green.</p><p>The round-robin style tournament goes down between Oct. 5 and Nov. 19, with 48 games scheduled among the 10 teams hitting the pitch. They are:</p><ul><li><p>India (hosts)</p></li><li><p>England (defending champions)</p></li><li><p>Australia</p></li><li><p>New Zealand</p></li><li><p>Pakistan</p></li><li><p>South Africa</p></li><li><p>Bangladesh</p></li><li><p>Afghanistan</p></li><li><p>Sri Lanka</p></li><li><p>Netherlands</p></li></ul><h2 id="what-time-are-cricket-world-cup-matches-in-the-us">What time are Cricket World Cup matches in the U.S.? </h2><p>Dedicated fans will have to keep extreme hours to watch these games live. Most matches begin at 2 p.m. IST (India Standard Time). That’s 4:30 a.m. ET at the beginning of the tournament, and 5:30 a.m. ET after the time change on Nov. 5.</p><p>There are a few games that take place at 10:30 a.m. IST. That’s 1 a.m. ET until the time change, after which you’ll be able to watch games at midnight.</p><p>You can check out the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-series/6732/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023/matches" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">full 2023 Cricket World Cup schedule right here.</a> </p><h2 id="how-to-stream-the-2023-cricket-world-cup">How to stream the 2023 Cricket World Cup</h2><p>Cricket isn’t on the top of many sports streaming services’ agendas in the U.S., but that actually makes it fairly simple to find the big games. A service called Willow TV has exclusive agreements to broadcast ICC cricket, home of the world cup (along with many, many other cricket leagues.). Willow’s broadcasts of championship games will be available on ESPN+ and Willow and Willow HD channels.</p><h2 id="best-overall-streaming-service-for-watching-2023s-cricket-world-cup-espn">Best overall streaming service for watching 2023’s Cricket World Cup: ESPN+</h2><p>Standalone sports streaming service ESPN+ is going to stream all 48 cricket World Cup 2023<strong> </strong>matches in both English and Hindi. The only downside to ESPN+ is that it only functions as a standalone platform, so you can’t watch it as a channel on another service. But you can download the free app on Xbox, Roku, Apple TV, and just about every other platform connected to your television. If you sing up, you can watch games on your desktop or phone too. Right now, ESPN+ costs $9.99 a month or $99.99 per year, but the price is going up to $10.99/mo. and $109.99/year on Oct. 12, so now’s the time to lock in the lower rate.</p><h2 id="best-streaming-service-for-hardcore-cricket-fans-sling-tv">Best streaming service for hardcore cricket fans: Sling TV</h2><p>Willow TV is the only 24/7 live cricket channel in the U.S. The network is broadcasting every game from the ICC ODI World Cup 2023 tourney live as they happen, with other cricket matches and cricket-based programming streaming for the rest of the day, every day.</p><p>If you want cricket as part of your streaming package (assuming you can even handle that much cricket) you need Willow, and it’s least expensive to stream on Sling TV. To get Willow, subscribe to either Sling’s Orange or Blue tier (base rate $40 per month) and add Desi Binge+ for $15 month after a bargain month at $10. You could also add Dashin for $20 a month ($10 for the first month) or Dashin Mega for an initial $12.50 a month and $25 per month after that.</p><p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.willow.tv/tvchannel" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Willow TV’s website</a> indicates the channel can be purchased as an add-on to Sling TV, and as part of the Telugu, Urdu, Tamil, and Bangla packages. But I spent an inordinate amount of time on the phone with Sling’s customer service, and they tell me that you cannot subscribe to Willow or Willow HD as standalone channels, and they are not available through any international packages other than Desi Binge+ and Dashin and Dashin Mega.</p><p><strong>Runnerup: DirecTV Stream.</strong> DirecTV Stream also offers Willow TV as part of its sports package, but it’s a little more expensive than Sling TV. Right now, DirecTV’s entertainment package is $64.99 for three months, and $74.99 thereafter. The sports package add-on is free for three months, then goes up to $14.99 per month.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Stephen Johnson is a Staff Writer for Lifehacker where he covers pop culture, including two weekly columns “The Out of Touch Adults’ Guide to Kid Culture” and “What People are Getting Wrong this Week.” He graduated from Emerson College with a BFA in Writing, Literature, and Publishing.</p><p>Previously, Stephen was Managing Editor at NBC/Universal’s G4TV.

But with the right suite of tools, your phone can also be one of your greatest allies when it comes to studying and scheduling. Here are some of the best studying and time management apps every college student should consider.</p><h2 id="the-best-apps-for-studying-and-schoolwork">The best apps for studying and schoolwork</h2><p>There are many beloved all-purpose study apps out there(like the beloved Evernote) but sometimes you can also benefit from ones designed for specific tasks:</p><ul><li><p><strong><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://quizlet.com" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Quizlet</a> </strong>is well known among students, if only for how often you’ll find someone else has already uploaded your homework to it. Yes, this lets you cheat a little, but the app offers more than that: You can make your own flashcards or use someone else’s flashcard deck. If you join the paid version ($7.99 per month), you get access to multiple choice questions and practice tests too. Whatever you’re studying, somebody has already uploaded it to the app. Grab it on the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quizlet-ai-powered-flashcards/id546473125" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Apple app store</a> or <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quizlet.quizletandroid&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Google Play</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://otter.ai/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Otter</a></strong> transcribes audio in real time, enabling you to record lectures and create notes simultaneously. It has a bunch of cool other features: For instance, once you give a speaker a name, it recognizes them and includes their name every time you record them. You can also edit anything that the transcription service doesn’t quite nail and can link it to Zoom or Google Meet to transcribe what’s happening in online classes. You get 300 monthly transcription minutes (30 minutes per session) for free before you’ll need to upgrade to Pro for $8.33 per month.

It can produce citations in Chicago, MLA, or whatever other format you’re being asked to use, and it offers a fast, simple alternative to other citation makers—especially when you’re referencing physical books, which are laborious to manually input into other generators. While it has other app-based competitors that also scan barcodes, not all of them are available for Apple and Android devices.

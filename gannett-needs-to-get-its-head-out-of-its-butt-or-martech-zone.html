With Gannett, they really have brought the expression to reality, though. Ruth Holladay is a wickedly sarcastic blogger with a sharp tongue… and she’s dead-on, especially when it <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2007/08/09/is-gannett-girding-for-a-sale/" target="_blank">comes to Gannett</a> and the Indianapolis Star.</p><p></p><p>We both used to work there, Ruth retiring from editorial and me getting an escort when Gannett brought in a VP who cleared out my entire Presidential-award winning marketing department.</p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Gannett For Sale?</h2><p></p><p>The recent rumors are that <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2007/08/09/is-gannett-girding-for-a-sale/" target="_blank">Gannett might be preparing for sale soon</a>. I don’t care. I sold my stock as soon as I left, recognizing that my departure was another symptom of <em>Monsterus Corporititus</em>, also known as <em>having your head up your butt</em>.</p><p></p><p>First, some background – I worked for two Newspaper organizations – Landmark and Gannett. Although the two companies were similar in industry, they couldn’t be more different in management. While Landmark believed in autonomy for its properties and managers, Gannett believed in centralization andcontrol.</p><p></p><p>As a Database Marketer at a Gannett newspaper, I had competition in the local region and the corporate headquarters. It wasn’t outwardly obvious, and I had great relationships with corporate – but the fact was that, for them to be successful, corporate had to put me out of business. The more the corporation could prove its worth by developing corporate strategies, the more staff it could eliminate from the local newspaper. Their livelihood, bonuses, and promotions depended on it. So, while I may have had more experience and been a better performer – that kind of information had to be downplayed in McLean, Virginia.</p><p></p><p>Gannett does this throughout all departments, most critically in Editorial. Any newspaper’s largest competitive advantage over the Internet and other media resources is its local talent. These people have created relationships in the community and know where the cracks and concerns are when it comes to our civic leadership. It’s also the department that seems to make the most sacrifices. The people I was friends with in Editorial worked their butts off day and night with tons of open positions that were never going to be filled. Many of them are gone now… a great loss for this city.</p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">It’s Easy to See WHERE the Profits go:</h2><p></p><p>The Indianapolis Star is now a mix of AP and advertisements with just a sprinkling of local reporting. Industry experts will tell you these cuts have been necessary because people turn to the web for their news and information.</p><p></p><p>I can’t put into words how upset that gets me. It’s like blaming Toyota for failed sales in domestic autos. Gannett Corporate Employees have no one to blame but themselves. They could leverage their solid standing in the community for both advertising and editorials. Instead, they made the local newspaper relinquish editorial control to the corporation.</p><p></p><p>The Indianapolis Star versus Gannett will provide the most apparent proof of how things work.</p><p></p><p>While Gannett won awards with one of the most incredible corporate headquarters in the country, The Indianapolis Star could be voted one of the ugliest in the city. I got to work in an attached building, the American Building… which was rumored to be inhabitable outside the first few floors. I realize this isn’t <em>the</em> issue, it’s just a great visual of it.</p><p></p><p>It appears that profit margins are sustained through attrition and circulation losses. Locally, the Star supplements its editorials with photographs and blog posts from its readers. While I agree that this is a good business decision, it’s sad to see the savings being pushed to corporate instead of invested in local talent.</p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">IndyMoms: A LOCAL Success</h2><p></p><p>IndyMoms was an example of how things good be done right. IndyMoms’ General Manager was Jennifer Gombach, a fantastically talented woman I enjoyed working with at The Star.</p><p></p><p>Jennifer is not just a talented marketer, writer and entrepreneur, she’s also a local and has been with the newspaper for a long time (and was frequently overlooked). I would have loved the opportunity to work under Jennifer while I was there. She was a great mentor and a good friend.</p><p></p><p>IndyMoms grew to incredible success, before it was trashed by corporate.</p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Gannett SHOULD Do</h2><p></p><p>If Gannett wishes to make a go of it, the layoffs need to start with their corporate staff. I’ll apologize to my friends and colleagues at corporate beforehand, but your problems lie here.</p><p></p><p>Provide your local newspaper with the autonomy they need to sustain the business. Allow them to invest in their local resources and hold them accountable. Investment must cut into the profit margins they’ve grown to love at headquarters, but it’s necessary. Begin promoting from within the newspapers instead of shuffling talent nationwide.</p><p></p><p>Take a look at what Jennifer had done with IndyMoms. It was local, it was personal, and it was popular. They connected with readers and provided a perfect medium for local advertisers to connect with a specific local demographic. It’s the perfect recipe for success and could be repeated repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Gannett needs to get its head out of its butt. Some folks say <strong>All politics is local</strong>! In the Newspaper Industry, <strong>All dollars are local</strong>! I wouldn’t hold my breath waiting for Gannett to fire itself.</p><p></p><div id="div-gpt-ad-1703691464135-0" style="min-width: 250px; height: auto;"></div><p></p><p></p></div></article></main><a href="https://martech.zone/gannett-indymoms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><b>Source: martech.zone</b></a><p></p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on January 3, 2025</div><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/authors/andre-yulianto/" title="Andre Yulianto">Andre Yulianto</a></h4></div></div><nav class="content__nav box"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/wordpress-plugin-login-easily-with-teleport.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>WordPress Plugin: Login Easily With Teleport</h5></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/a-complete-list-of-2024-retail-sales-andamp-holidays-to-plan-your-marketing-campaigns-or-martech-zone.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>A Complete List Of 2024 Retail Sales &amp;amp; Holidays To Plan Your Marketing Campaigns | Martech Zone</h5></div></a></div></nav><div class="content__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related-wrap"><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/mastercard-names-devin-corr-as-head-of-investor-relations.html" class="inverse">Mastercard Names Devin Corr as head of Investor Relations</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-06T03:23" class="u-small">January 6, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/hive-collaborative-efficient-campaign-and-workflow-management-for-marketing-teams-and-agencies-or-martech-zone.html" class="inverse">Hive: Collaborative, Efficient Campaign And Workflow Management For Marketing Teams And Agencies | Martech Zone</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-04T04:52" class="u-small">January 4, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/the-rise-of-the-second-screen-statistics-trends-and-marketing-tips-or-martech-zone.html" class="inverse">The Rise Of The Second Screen: Statistics, Trends, And Marketing Tips | Martech Zone</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-04T01:14" class="u-small">January 4, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/authors/andre-yulianto/" class="authors__title">Andre Yulianto</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 633</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="newsletter box box--gray"><h3 class="box__title">Newsletter</h3><p class="newsletter__description">Sign up to receive email updates and to hear what's going on with us!</p><form>...</form></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/tags/blog/">blog</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li><li><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/tags/lorem-ipsum/">lorem ipsum</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/">Go Blog</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

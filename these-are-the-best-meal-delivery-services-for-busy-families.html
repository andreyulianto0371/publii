From getting to and from work to running kids to soccer practice, helping with homework, and putting a (healthy) meal on the table night after night feels like a pipe dream.</p><p>But, as meal and food delivery services have grown in popularity over the last decade, so have their menu selections, with many offering meals specifically created for families, including baby food and other options aimed at a young, developing palate. In other words, if you’re trying to get out of your macaroni-and-chicken-nugget rut, you might want to try one of these eight food delivery services that cater to families and kids.</p><h2 id="everyplate">EveryPlate</h2><p>With 26 recipes to choose from, including chicken sausage orzotto and black bean quesadillas, you can make something new for your family nearly every day of the month with EveryPlate. You can choose between plans that include fancy, classic, or quick and easy recipes, and their website claims that their weekly meal kits are the most affordable among their competitors.</p><h2 id="little-spoon">Little Spoon</h2><p>Finding healthy food your baby or toddler will actually eat is like searching for that last LEGO brick to complete the set: It’s seems impossible. Little Spoon crafts meal plans for the stage of feeding your child is in, from organic purees filled with superfoods to balanced school lunches, offering healthier takes on the often-frowned-upon chicken nuggets. However, there are some trade-offs for great taste and convenience, particularly regarding cost, as shipping isn’t included. Boxes are sent every two weeks instead of weekly.</p><h2 id="once-upon-a-farm">Once Upon A Farm</h2><p>Probably best known for its association with actress Jennifer Garner, Once Upon A Farm is focused more on finger foods and puree pouches for the younger set, meaning it doesn’t have the same variety as other delivery services. However, their products are also available in stores, so if your toddler craves more of that mango, carrot, navy bean, and coconut butter meal, it’s just a Target run away.</p><h2 id="hungryroot">Hungryroot</h2><p>Hungryroot claims it offers consumers the best aspects of delivery services and grocery shopping with personalized recommendations, pantry selections, and affordable, quick-prepared meals with quality food. However, what really sets the service apart is its 2-in-1 recipes, which are meals with an overlapping set of ingredients so you can make two meals simultaneously: One for you and the other for the picky eaters in your home.</p><h2 id="purple-carrot">Purple Carrot</h2><p>If you’re interested in a more plant-based diet, Purple Carrot has you covered with sweet treats and dinners that appeal to vegans, including Zucchini Corn Cakes and Malai Chickpea Dumplings. A little higher priced than your typical meal delivery service, the service also offers prepared meals that are slightly cheaper than their meal kit counterparts.</p><h2 id="yumble">Yumble</h2><p>More of a grocery service than meal delivery, Yumble sends parents healthy lunch and snack combinations with familiar products (Larabar, Sun-Maid) that won’t throw your kid’s food pyramid out of shape—for around the same price as a Happy Meal. Parents can also customize each lunch bag for their picky eaters.</p><h2 id="nurture-life">Nurture Life</h2><p>The variety of Nurture Life’s heat-and-serve menu is much more robust than other kid-based services, with butter chicken and cheesy lasagna swirl making up some of the selections. There’s also something for every age, from finger foods for kids who are just learning to self-feed to sweet snacks and smoothies.</p><h2 id="dinnerly">Dinnerly</h2><p>Flexibility is the theme of Dinnerly’s service, with recipes designed for quick weekday prep, including chicken tacos and zucchini pizza boats, with different plans for every budget. However, it does remain unbending regarding ingredient substitutions due to allergies, requiring you to select a different recipe if you’re sensitive to specific ingredients.</p><p></p><p>Jason Keil is a writer, editor, and podcaster based in Phoenix, Arizona.

Many report that spending time at sex-positive resorts helps to erode at the sexual shame and stigma that tends to be the norm in Western culture.”</p><p>Aside from the potential for having sex in public, making new erotic connections, and discovering new sexual explorations, O’Reilly shares that many sex-positive resorts also create spaces to spend time naked, which can offer the corollary benefits of boosted self-esteem and body image.</p><p>“The atmosphere at the best sex-positive resorts is open, non-judgmental, and friendly — regardless of your interests or relationship status,” she says. “And of course, many report that sex positive resorts result in a boost to their sex lives — in terms of desire, excitement, passion and creativity.”</p><p>Below, O’Reilly and other sexperts reveal their favorite sex resorts to visit and why.</p><h2 id="hedonism-ii-negril-jamaica">Hedonism II (Negril, Jamaica)</h2><p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.hedonism.com/hedonism-resort/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Hedonism II</a> is a well-known adult-only, clothing-optional resort that embraces a sex-positive and open-minded atmosphere.

It encourages guests to explore their desires and fantasies in a safe and respectful environment by allowing optional clothing to be worn at the resort, including being topless or completely naked. “This resort is popular for swinging couples but can also be enjoyed by non-swinging couples too,” Johnson says. “It is a place to explore any unspoken desires and kinks. I would suggest purchasing one of the luxury rooms, as these come with a hot tub, which can also be used to spice up your stay!”</p><h2 id="stay-amp-play-salinas-california">Stay &amp; Play (Salinas, California)</h2><p>Kinky and dreaming of the west coast?

Similar to the others, Johnson says this resort has fun and exciting themed parties and swimming pools, embracing a relaxing and encouraging atmosphere where couples can enjoy their time together with ease. “However, it is important to note that any sexual activity is not allowed in public areas,” she says. “This resort offers all-inclusive options, two swimming pools (one sexy one and one quieter one), and an option of two different al la carte restaurants to indulge!”</p><h2 id="desire-greek-isles-cruise-and-temptation-cruises">Desire Greek Isles cruise and Temptation Cruises</h2><p>If you’re

in a few weeks,” she says. “They’re unique experiences that balance a sex-positive environment with gorgeous ports, so you can enjoy art, culture, history as well as the erotic side of your vacation.”</p><p>She notes these cruises are for couples, and they offer clothing-optional areas (e.g. pool deck), erotic entertainment, relationship and sexuality workshops (that’s where I come in!) and an on-board playroom.</p><p>If you’re single or don’t want to travel as a couple, she suggests traveling via their sister cruise company, <a rel="nofollow noopener"

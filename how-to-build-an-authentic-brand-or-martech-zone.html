We want to feel a connection to it. Being human is the only way to win.” In his famous golden circle model and TED Talks, <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action" target="_blank">Simon Sinek</a> points out that the <em>why</em> upon which a company is founded has to be so strong, that the company can sell any type of product from this platform.</p><div class="stream-item stream-item-in-post stream-item-inline-post aligncenter"><div class="stream-item-size"><p></p><div id="div-gpt-ad-1703678894794-0" style="min-width: 680px; min-height: 15px;"><script><restore-line-break>    googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1703678894794-0'); });<restore-line-break></script></div></div></div><p>In spite of different generations and starting points, these gifted marketing professionals are all talking about the same thing: <strong>Human Brands</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Nothing new is at stake. It isn’t new for companies to seek out authenticity – and it isn’t new for companies to focus on listening to their recipients and admitting to their mistakes rather than spending all their time trying to convince and seduce their customers.</p><p></p><p>The paradigm shift can be seen in research such as <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.slideshare.net/linkedin-talent-solutions/linkedin-lippincott-brand-webcast" target="_blank">The Lippincott-LinkedIn Brand Power Score</a>, which stands to prove that a more personal, vulnerable, and human approach to communications and branding is well-received by the clientele. Research has shown that consumers have overtaken the predictions set out by experts, making human marketing the undeniable way forward.</p><p></p><p>The question is this: Can your brand keep up?</p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Human Brand</h2><p></p><p>Authentic marketing hasn’t just appeared out of thin air. Various movements and trends have inspired it through the years, such as hyper transparency, co-creation, open-source, crowdsourcing, the learning brand, anti-branding, etc.</p><p></p><p>But two things have caused the simultaneous marketing paradigm shift:</p><p></p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Authentic marketing is an expression of movements – not brands</h4><p></p><p>The phenomenon is centred on companies, through conscious and consistent work on their personalities and responsiveness, becoming wholesome movements rather than flat brands.</p><p></p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><figure class="wp-image-118674"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/618/toddy-logo.png" alt="PepsiCo Toddy Brand Logo" title="How To Build An Authentic Brand 2" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/618/responsive/toddy-logo-xs.png 300w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/618/responsive/toddy-logo-sm.png 480w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/618/responsive/toddy-logo-md.png 768w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/618/responsive/toddy-logo-lg.png 1024w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/618/responsive/toddy-logo-xl.png 1360w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/618/responsive/toddy-logo-2xl.png 1600w"></figure></figure></div><p>Take <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.iprofesional.com/actualidad/330366-toddy-conocias-la-curiosa-historia-de-esta-mitica-chocolatada" target="_blank">Pepsi’s Brazilian Toddy</a> campaign as an example: </p><p></p><p>In Brazil, sales for the <em>Toddy</em> chocolate drink had begun to stagnate and the market began to demand something new. Pepsi already had a mascot, loosely admired on a superficial level, especially by younger consumers. They considered him cute and entertaining, which is how we tend to perceive brand mascots.</p><p></p><p>Pepsi went out on a limb and made their mascot a spokesperson for an external movement. Pepsi had identified a strong movement on social media. A range of organisations and individuals was carrying this movement forwards, focusing on the prevalence of action-less statements. The movement focused on a nation characterised by corruption as well as broken and empty promises.</p><p></p><p>Pepsi suggested that the younger generations used online dialogue initiatives to make a statement out of the mascot’s <em>moo</em> every time an empty promise was heard – and the campaign was successful.</p><p></p><p>In no time, <em>moo</em> because synonymous with <em>cut the crap</em>. The younger generations implemented the <em>moo</em>-message in their conversations, both online and offline. All of a sudden, Toddy was part of a trend. Sales of the product spiked and Pepsi transformed their brand to a movement.</p><p></p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. A shift from customer to human focus</h4><p></p><p>Rather than focusing on methods for convincing the recipients, such as campaigns, strategies, spins, etc., marketing will gradually begin to focus more on discovering why people make purchases. In the future, this will be a starting point for product development.</p><p></p><p>This is part of the reason why authentic marketing is about people (not customers) and our most fundamental needs. These needs include:</p><p></p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Being heard</li><li>Feeling understood</li><p></p><li>Finding meaning</li><p></p><li>Showing personality</li></ul><p>An example of this second aspect of the paradigm shift can be seen in the American chain Dominos.</p><p></p><p>At the start of the noughties, Dominos was under fire for food quality, worker satisfaction, and worker enjoyment. Rather than becoming defensive and launching campaigns to convince the customers of the opposite, Dominos chose to implement a humble and responsive crisis strategy. Dominos equipped several of their pizza boxes with QR codes, asking customers to scan the code and take it to Twitter to express their opinions.</p><p></p><p>This was a successful strategy, as all people feel the need to be heard and feel understood.  </p><p></p><p>The strategy resulted in the collection of large amounts of data that the company put to good use in a variety of different ways:</p><p></p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>As part of their external marketing, <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1768899/pie-sky-dominos-flips-switch-times-square-instant-reviews-takes-transparency-new-level" target="_blank">Dominos bought some of the most expensive advertising spaces in the United States, including Times Square billboards</a>, all just to show these customer tweets in real-time. Even bad reviews were shown, to promote a brand image of honesty and transparency. Hence Dominos showed that they were intent on listening louder.</li></ul><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><figure class="wp-image-118675"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/618/dominos-timessquare.jpg" alt="Dominos in Times Square" title="How To Build An Authentic Brand 3" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/618/responsive/dominos-timessquare-xs.jpg 300w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/618/responsive/dominos-timessquare-sm.jpg 480w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/618/responsive/dominos-timessquare-md.jpg 768w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/618/responsive/dominos-timessquare-lg.jpg 1024w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/618/responsive/dominos-timessquare-xl.jpg 1360w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/618/responsive/dominos-timessquare-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Credit: <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1768899/pie-sky-dominos-flips-switch-times-square-instant-reviews-takes-transparency-new-level" target="_blank">Fast Company</a></figcaption></figure></div><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>As part of their internal marketing and employee care, Dominos set up computer screens in the areas where pizzas were being produced to provide bakers with real-time feedback. This effectively bridged the gap between employees and customers.</li></ul><p>The campaign resulted in an increase of 80,000 Twitter followers in under a month. Other results included a spike in PR attention, an increase in worker satisfaction, an all-around improvement in the reputation of the brand, and an increase in humanity. This is authentic marketing at its finest!</p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Marketing That Promises Just Enough</h2><p></p><p>There are many wonderful examples of companies opening their eyes to the advantages of authentic marketing. The result is success stories brought about by unique campaigns that sit well with the clientele.</p><p></p><p>At my MarTech company, JumpStory, we’ve specialized in curating authentic stock photos &amp; videos, so you don’t have to use all the cheesy-looking ones that are out there. We use AI to get rid of all the inauthentic content, and we focus on two keywords that are also the essence of authentic marketing: humanity &amp; personality.</p><p></p><p>These cases are meant to inspire you to make the transition into a more responsive and human brand – and with this transition, reap the economic benefits along the way.</p><p></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Humanity</h3><p></p><p>One American retail chain was under fire for often running out of their most popular products. In response to this criticism, the company launched a new slogan – and with it, a new mindset: <em>If it is in stock, we have it.</em> This hard-core self-irony had a positive impact on both sales and brand reputation.</p><p></p><p>In God’s own country, you could come across a Chinese restaurant chain that advertises under the slogan <em>Original food. Poor English. </em>Aside from this humour and self-irony, the punch line articulates a classic issue within the restaurant industry. For a customer seeking authenticity, one of the worst things that can happen is going to an Italian restaurant only to be served by a fully Danish server. What we want is a swarthy beauty to serve our pizzas with passion.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, we want to be able to understand every word on the menu and communicate well with the staff. This sometimes proves difficult if authenticity is our priority. The Chinese chain articulates this exact dilemma and takes a stand on the matter.</p><p></p><p>Both cases are examples of the phenomenon that <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3HkVmqH" target="_blank">Trendwatching</a> dubs <em>flawsome</em>. The term is a portmanteau of the words <em>awesome</em> and <em>flawed</em>. In much the same way as Dove’s Real Beauty campaigns, these two American cases show that you can explore your humanity and at the same time limit your promises to those that are truly achievable. In fact, these chains almost promise less than they offer.</p><p></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Personality</h3><p></p><p>In theory, all brands have a unique personality, in much the same way as human beings do. Fact remains that some personalities are more appealing than others. Some stand out in a positive, radical way. In some cases, we can pinpoint the exact reason and in others, it seems to lie just beyond our reach.</p><p></p><p>Within the world of marketing, there are a few noticeable examples of this phenomenon. Miracle Whip stands out with its <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://progressivegrocer.com/miracle-whip-admits-were-not-everyone" target="_blank">We’re Not For Everyone</a> story; Innocent Drinks are famous for their humour and frankness. An example of this personality is the text that can be found on the bottom of the majority of their juice cartons, which reads: <em>Stop looking at my bottom</em>.</p><p></p><p>Within the USA, most people know of the Southwest Airlines case. The company has adopted a policy that states, that no security announcements should be identical. Go to YouTube and see the example of a young flight attendant rapping his way through the security procedures on-board the aircraft. Notice how this approach is practically met by standing ovation.</p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you haven't looked at the bottom of our smoothie bottles lately, now might be a good time to take a peek. <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://t.co/tsw2Fs8WD1" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/tsw2Fs8WD1</a></p><p>— innocent drinks (@innocent) <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://twitter.com/innocent/status/403168906182815744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">November 20, 2013</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><restore-line-break></restore-line-break></p></div></figure><p><restore-line-break><restore-line-break><restore-line-break><restore-line-break><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Developing And Measuring Humanity</h2><p><restore-line-break><restore-line-break><restore-line-break><restore-line-break><p>Humanity is one of the few characteristics with the power to move customers, products, and sympathy.

At the same time, no parent wants to deny their child’s dream of pursuing soccer, hip-hop, karate—after all, who doesn’t want an extra black belt around the house?</p><p>Even if their dreams are short-lived, extracurricular activities like sports, music lessons, art classes, and more provide invaluable experiences for kids. The unfortunate reality, however, is those invaluable experiences come with costs that <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/parents-money-youth-sports-extracurricular-college-bae794bb" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">add up quick</a>. Use these tips to keep your budget under control while still allowing your child to pursue their interests.</p><h2 id="do-your-research">Do your research</h2><p>Your kid may be the one back in school, but there’s research for you to do too. Many community centers, parks departments, libraries, and schools offer affordable or even free extracurricular activities. Check their websites or call to learn what is available. For example, your local YMCA or park district may have sports leagues, while the library may offer free music or language lessons.</p><p>Also look into activities offered through community or non-profit organizations like Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, 4-H clubs, and churches. And don’t forget to check if your employer offers discounted classes or memberships as an employee benefit.</p><h2 id="buy-used-supplies-and-equipment">Buy used supplies and equipment</h2><p>From instruments to uniforms to gear, gently used equipment is significantly cheaper than buying new, and works just as well. Check online marketplaces in particular for local deals on high-quality used items.</p><p>The equipment department is where you’ll probably have to practice saying “no” to your kid. Before succumbing to all the marketing tactics involved in selling you fancy cleats and instruments, figure out if the equipment is really necessary before you buy.</p><h2 id="fundraise">Fundraise</h2><p>Many extracurricular programs organize fundraisers to help families offset costs like travel expenses. Get involved by having your child participate in the fundraiser sales or activities. This allows everyone to contribute what they can.</p><p>You can also have your own fundraiser by creating a signup for friends and family to sponsor your child. Even small donations of $5-20 from several people add up. Offer to advertise donors’ businesses or leave thank you notes in exchange.</p><h2 id="maximize-hand-me-downs">Maximize hand-me-downs</h2><p>Younger siblings, cousins, teammates, and neighbors may have uniforms, instruments, gear, costumes, and other supplies that no longer fit or that they no longer need. Ask around to save on purchasing these items new each season or school year.</p><h2 id="when-in-doubt-just-ask">When in doubt, just ask</h2><p>Even if you don’t see discounts being clearly advertised, it doesn’t hurt to ask. Here are some types of discounts to try and open up for negotiation:</p><ul><li><p>Referral discount: See about a discount for referring friends and family members who sign up for lessons, too.</p></li><li><p>Group discount: Enroll your kid and their siblings or friends for a group discount.</p></li><li><p>Returning student discount: If you’ve proven your family is loyal and committed to this activity, the organizer may be open to a deal to make sure your kid doesn’t have to quit.</p></li></ul><p>With a little creativity and advanced planning, you can keep those extracurricular activity budgets under control. Your child will still benefit from these enriching experiences while you maintain your financial goals.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Meredith Dietz is Lifehacker’s Senior Finance Writer.

Mobile hotspots make it easy to pass a smartphone’s data plan over to wifi-only devices, but that isn’t the case for everyone: Wifi is still important for many of us. Not all of us have unlimited data plans, and cell reception also isn’t perfect—there are plenty of areas of low to no service. In those cases, wifi is essential again.</p><p>Some locations are almost a given for free wifi. Coffee shops are probably the most famous, with remote workers and aspiring screenwriters alike use them as a makeshift office. Occasionally though, even cafés take a stance against making it easy for customers to connect. “No free wifi. Pretend like it’s 1995 and talk to each other” signs are the enemy of those of us searching for an internet connection. Hotels and other businesses typically have wifi available, but often the networks are locked behind passwords or other forms of authentication.</p><h2 id="be-careful-with-free-wifi-maps">Be careful with free wifi maps</h2><p>To be sure your destination has free wifi you can connect to, you can use a wifi map. These services compile all available free wifi networks in your area, so you can plan accordingly. You don’t want to pick your wifi map haphazardly, though: These services are especially hot targets for creepy activity, because developers know a lot of people are going to be looking for free wifi.</p><p>As far as apps go, your best bet is <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.wifimap.io/6208-new-york-free-wifi/map" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">WiFi Map</a>. It has its own website, so you don’t need the app, but you might prefer it: The <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wifi-map-tripbox-find-hotspot/id548925969" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">iPhone</a> and <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.wifimap.wifimap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Android</a> apps allow you to see a more detailed map of wifi locations, including the health of each network.</p><p>WiFi Map isn’t perfect as far as privacy goes. According to the iOS App Store’s App Privacy report, WiFi map tracks your purchase history, user ID, and device ID, and has access to data linked to said user ID. However, it’s better than the competition. A similar app, <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instabridge-wifi-passwords/id971679641" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Instabridge</a>, tracks your device ID and your usage data through “product interaction” with the app. It also collects data linked to your identity from both those data points, as well as search history, browsing history, and your user ID. Whichever wifi map you use, I recommend blocking its ability to track your activity on iPhone through Apple’s App Tracking Transparency, and on Android through the DuckDuckGo app.</p><h2 id="always-use-a-vpn-when-connecting-to-public-wifi">Always use a VPN when connecting to public wifi</h2><p>But your privacy concerns aren’t over. Once you confirm the local baristas aren’t total hipsters and will offer you free wifi, you shouldn’t connect to it without using a VPN. Why? Because free wifi is susceptible to spying, and makes you vulnerable to anyone that knows their way around such activities. You’ve probably heard you shouldn’t access banking sites while using public wifi, but you really shouldn’t do anything on public wifi without protecting your connection.</p><p>While dealing with a VPN seems like a hassle just to connect to Slack from Starbucks, it will reduce your risk of exposure considerably. VPNs encrypt your traffic and route it through a proxy server, usually in an entirely different country than the one you’re operating in. An outside observer won’t be able to access your traffic, nor will they be able to tell where you are, even if they’re siting right next to your latte. Check out our full guide for more information on how VPNs can help when using free public wifi.</p><p>All that to say, free wifi should be your last option. If possible, use your smartphone’s mobile hotspot and make sure the connection is password protected. But, I mean, let’s be real: We all use free wifi when we have to. I frequently work out of coffee shops and I sure don’t burn through my phone’s hotspot each and every time. As with many things in life, it’s all about doing it as safely as you can, preferably with a good cup of coffee to boot.</p><p>[<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/no-internet-no-problem-heres-how-to-get-wi-fi-anywhere-for-free/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">CNET</a>]</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jake Peterson is Lifehacker’s Senior Technology Editor.

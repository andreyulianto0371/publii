Here’s what I did:</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Get the right tools</strong></h3><p>The first step to successful paranormal investigation (and simple home remodeling projects) is having the right tools for the job. I eschewed ghost hunting apps that sold themselves as games, and downloaded the following popular apps from the Apple store:</p><ul><li><p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ghost-hunting-tools/id1025393457" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Ghost Hunting Tools</a>: This app says it was “developed for beginners and professionals in paranormal research.” It features an EMF meter (ghosts love electromagnetic fields for unspecified reasons) and an EVP recorder that captures ghost sounds that are imperceptible to human ears. It then translates those sounds into words.</p></li><li><p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ghost-detector-haunted-radar/id1089084515#?platform=iphone" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">GhostDetector—Haunted Radar</a>: This app promises it is more “accurate and sensitive than any of its counterparts.” It purports to detect EMF fields to find ghosts, and has over 9,000 reviews on the app store and a score of 4.2. Plus, it’s the best-looking of the ghost apps I downloaded.</p></li><li><p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ghost-finder-tools/id1423119459" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Ghost Finder Tools</a>: This app says it’s the “most used by ghost hunters all over the world.” It features six tools for ghost hunting that can be unlocked once you view an advertisement for “Solitaire Cash.”</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Step 2: Go to the right location</strong></h3><p>Most ghost-hunting apps promise to help locate the ghosts around you, but I don’t want to know if there are ghosts in my house—I have to live here—so I chose an infamous haunted location for my investigation: picnic table 29 in Los Angeles’ Griffith Park.</p><h2>The legend of the haunted picnic table</h2><p></p><figure class="border border-gray-100"><img src="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699834236.jpg" alt="Lifehacker Image" width="2000" height="1126" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GWFX1G4NPKS472910GYNE/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1699834236.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GWFX1G4NPKS472910GYNE/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1699834236.jpg 1400w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699834236.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699834236-xs.jpg 300w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699834236-sm.jpg 480w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699834236-md.jpg 768w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699834236-lg.jpg 1024w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699834236-xl.jpg 1360w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1699834236-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p>Credit: Stephen Johnson</p><p>On Halloween night 1976, Rand Garrett and Nancy Jeanson, a promising musician and actress, were consummating their young love on top of a picnic table in a remote, desolate part of Griffith Park, or so legend has it. Just as things were getting good for the pair, a heavy tree crashed down on them, killing both instantly. The young lovers’ families decided to scatter their ashes at the site, that they might always be together—a weird decision, but it was the 70s.</p><p>Since then, it’s been said that all attempts to remove the tree or repair the table have been met with supernatural protest—malevolent voices whispering “leave us be” or “next time, you’ll die” have been reported, as has the mysterious disappearance of tree trimmers sent to clean up the spot.</p><p>I can’t find any verification that any of this actually happened, beyond the fact that a pine tree really did fall onto this picnic table at some point, but the site draws the curious and morbid to this day, who leave behind notes and tributes to the young couple.</p><p>It is a legitimately spooky spot.

(In the tradition of paranormal investigation, I made up all that stuff about the eclipse being a beacon, but it sounds good, right?)</p><p>Before leaving, I consulted Ghost Hunting Tools for any last minute advice from the spirit world. I let it listen for electronic voice phenomena in my home for a bit and translate the ghost-speak into English. An apparently friendly spirit said, “Bail” and “Warning.” No joke! Pleased with my message from The Beyond, I set off for the haunted picnic table.</p><p></p><figure class="border border-gray-100"><img src="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/images-3.fill.size_2000x1120.v1699834236.jpg" alt="Lifehacker Image" width="2000" height="1120" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GWFX1G4NPKS472910GYNE/images-3.fill.size_800x448.v1699834236.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GWFX1G4NPKS472910GYNE/images-3.fill.size_1400x784.v1699834236.jpg 1400w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/images-3.fill.size_2000x1120.v1699834236.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-3.fill.size_2000x1120.v1699834236-xs.jpg 300w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-3.fill.size_2000x1120.v1699834236-sm.jpg 480w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-3.fill.size_2000x1120.v1699834236-md.jpg 768w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-3.fill.size_2000x1120.v1699834236-lg.jpg 1024w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-3.fill.size_2000x1120.v1699834236-xl.jpg 1360w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-3.fill.size_2000x1120.v1699834236-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p>Credit: Stephen Johnson</p><p>My expectations were high as I approached the isolated corner of the park where the picnic table stands. It’s near the peak of Mount Hollywood, where the roads are closed to cars, so it requires a fairly strenuous hike or bike ride to visit. This protects the eerie isolation needed for ghost-peeping. I didn’t need an app to tell me that this is a spooky spot, especially because of the greeting cards, flowers, and candles left behind by others.</p><p>Right before the eclipse, I turned on my GhostDetector: Spirit Radar app, waiting for the sky to darken and the spirits to make themselves known. The anticipation was, I admit, pretty scary. But when the eclipse hit, nothing happened. There was no spike in EMF fields on my reader. No apparitions appeared. Even the eclipse itself was a bust—it got slightly darker, maybe, but the mountains and trees blocked my view of the sky anyway.</p><p></p><figure class="border border-gray-100"><img src="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/images-4.fill.size_381x750.v1699834236.jpg" alt="Lifehacker Image" width="381" height="750" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GWFX1G4NPKS472910GYNE/images-4.fill.size_800x1575.v1699834236.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GWFX1G4NPKS472910GYNE/images-4.fill.size_1400x2756.v1699834236.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2GWFX1G4NPKS472910GYNE/images-4.fill.size_2000x3938.v1699834236.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-4.fill.size_381x750.v1699834236-xs.jpg 300w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-4.fill.size_381x750.v1699834236-sm.jpg 480w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-4.fill.size_381x750.v1699834236-md.jpg 768w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-4.fill.size_381x750.v1699834236-lg.jpg 1024w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-4.fill.size_381x750.v1699834236-xl.jpg 1360w, https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/media/posts/468/responsive/images-4.fill.size_381x750.v1699834236-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p>Credit: Ghost Finder</p><p>I tried the other ghost hunting apps I’d downloaded and received similar non-results. Sometimes the unspecified gauges or needles would move, but not in any way I could interpret. So I sat in silence for awhile and allowed Ghost Hunting Tools to record the ambient noise of the picnic table. The “ghosts” said, “Reference Fade Market Steel Cord Incorporate Fork Negative.”</p><p>Among the problems with the ghost-hunting apps I tried is that they don’t include instructions. They’re basically collections of animated needles that seem to move randomly over gauges with labels like “aura.” You’d have to work hard to interpret their results in any way.</p><p>Before long, a trio of other amateur paranormal investigators showed up. They didn’t know how their apps worked either, but they told me they’d tried to research Rand and Nancy, and they couldn’t locate any verifiable accounts of the deaths. They interpreted this as something very spooky, not an indication that the whole thing was a legend. I started to say that if a wooden picnic table really was hit by a tree in 1976, it would have rotted away years ago, but I stopped myself—I didn’t want to ruin my new friends’ morning.</p><h3>Step 4: Try again</h3><p>So maybe there were no ghosts at the picnic table because no one actually died there, and ghosts don’t like hiking.

The detectors seemed slightly more lively inside than out, but only slightly. I took them on a tour of my palatial estate and there were no significant readings.</p><p>Before giving up entirely, I downloaded this non-ghost-based, seemingly legitimate <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emf-radiation-detector/id1046907307" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">EMF detector</a>. Using this app, a corner of my living room spiked the gauge, burying the needle to the right. Finally a result! The ghost hunting apps I tried did not show a similar spike. But whatever. It’s a ghost—proof of the supernatural.</p><p>Skeptics might argue that the high EMF area is right around my stereo speaker, and the closer I bring it to the magnet within the speaker, the higher the reading goes. But maybe I found a ghost that really likes music.</p><p>The fact that I couldn’t get any of the apps I’d downloaded to register an actual EMF field is troubling. But maybe they have some sophisticated software that separates everyday EMF fields from ghostly apparitions. Or maybe there’s nothing to ghost hunting apps at all.</p><h2 id="conclusion-i-could-not-find-ghosts-with-my-iphone">Conclusion: I could not find ghosts with my iPhone</h2><p>The October 1933 issue of Modern Mechanix magazine reported on<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.salon.com/2017/10/08/who-you-gonna-call-edison-and-the-science-of-talking-to-ghosts/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"> a strange semi-seance</a> Thomas Edison held at his Menlo Park laboratory in the 1920s. According to this account, on a dark, windy night, Edison gathered a collection of scientists, psychics, and mediums and unveiled a machine that fired a narrow beam of light into a photoelectric cell attached to a meter that recorded any fluctuations—the Edison Ghost Phone!</p><p>Edison (supposedly) had the mediums all contact the spirit world so he could observe and record anything supernatural passing through the room with his device—if ghosts appeared, surely they’d break the beam of light. The results of the experiment (and the experiment itself) were never made public by Edison, but all signs suggest it didn’t work—even with one of history’s greatest inventors running the show, nothing happened.</p><p>Nothing supernatural, anyway. Edison and his pals had a spooky evening of fun hanging out with mediums and entertaining the possibility that there is more to the world than we see. So it was with my experiment. I didn’t find ghosts, but I traveled to a really cool, spooky spot in Griffith Park, went to an aviation memorial, and met some friendly weirdos. Conclusion: Even though I couldn’t find ghosts with any iPhone apps, maybe the real ghosts are the friends we make along the way.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Stephen Johnson is a Staff Writer for Lifehacker where he covers pop culture, including two weekly columns “The Out of Touch Adults’ Guide to Kid Culture” and “What People are Getting Wrong this Week.” He graduated from Emerson College with a BFA in Writing, Literature, and Publishing.</p><p>Previously, Stephen was Managing Editor at NBC/Universal’s G4TV.

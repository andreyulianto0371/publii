All those monthly fees add up—subscribing to the top tier of services will now cost you more than cable—so why not cut down on those monthly fees by taking advantage of a free trial before paying for a new service?</p><p>Here’s here are 10 major streaming services that still offer free trials in 2023.</p><h2 id="prime-video">Prime Video</h2><p>You can receive a free 30-day trial of Prime Video when you sign up for a free trial of Amazon Prime. (If you have been inactive Amazon Prime user for at least 12 months, you qualify for the free trial again.) You can pay $9 per month for Prime Video access only, or $15 per month/$139 per year for an Amazon Prime membership, which includes a bunch of other benefits like free two-day shipping, access to Amazon Music streaming, and more.</p><h2 id="apple-tv">Apple TV+</h2><p>You can get an Apple TV+ 7-day free trial to check out the streaming service. However, if you buy an Apple iPhone, Mac, iPad, or Apple TV, you can get an extended 3-month free trial of Apple TV+. If you don’t cancel, you’ll pay $7 per month or $69 per year.</p><h2 id="crunchyroll">Crunchyroll</h2><p>Anime lovers can watch all their shows with a 14-day free trial. Afterward, you’ll pay a monthly fee of $7.99 for the “Fan” plan, $9.99 for the “Mega fan” plan, or $14.99 for the “Ultimate fan” tier. None of the plans have ads; the primary difference is how many concurrent streams are allowed.</p><h2 id="discovery">Discovery+</h2><p>Though HBO Max and Discovery+ were said to be “merging” into Max, Discovery+ still exists as a standalone service, and you can get<strong> </strong>a <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.discoveryplus.com/?c1=Performancemktg&amp;c2=Google&amp;c3=SEMcopy&amp;c4=NA&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAsOmABhAwEiwAEBR0Zj4mEy4aCJvH4uzgWxh28ipq0ad5reJ4HvQYAgU1aeE1NoH0_-pbGhoCDGEQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">7-day free trial</a> as a new subscriber. Discovery+ offers two subscription tiers, a $5 per month plan with ads and a $7 per month plan with no ads and the option to download shows to watch on a mobile device.</p><h2 id="hulu">Hulu</h2><p>You can get a free 30-day trial for Hulu’s standard service and a 7-day free trial for the Live TV package. Hulu currently offers a basic plan for $8 a month with ads and a Hulu Premium with no ads for $15. You can also combine either plan and get a bundle with Hulu’s Live TV package, ESPN+, and Disney+ for $70 with ads and $83 with no ads.</p><h2 id="paramount-with-showtime">Paramount+ With Showtime</h2><p>You can get a 7-day free trial if you’re a new subscriber to Paramount+ With Showtime. You’ll have to choose and sign up for one of their plans to get it, but it’s easy to cancel before the deadline if you change your mind. Otherwise, you can pay $5.99 a month for the basic Paramount+ Essential plan, or $11.99 a month for Paramount+ with Showtime, which includes additional content that used to be a part of the standalone Showtime app.</p><h2 id="youtube-tv">YouTube TV</h2><p>You can get a YouTube TV 30-day free trial as a first-time subscriber. Make sure to cancel before the trial ends if you aren’t in love with the service—otherwise, you’d have to cough up $64.99 for your first three months, and then $72.99 a month thereafter. You’ll get access to over 100 channels and live sports.</p><h2 id="the-criterion-channel">The Criterion Channel</h2><p>With its devotion to classic and contemporary art films, The Criterion Channel—a spinoff of the iconic Criterion Collection home media label—is a bit more niche than some of these other offerings, which may be why it still offers a 7-day free trial. If you like what you see (and if you like movies, I think you will), you can sign up for $11 a month or $100 a year (which is like getting three months free).</p><h2 id="mubi">MUBI</h2><p>Like The Criterion Channel, MUBI is a streaming services geared toward cinema buffs, with an emphasis on independent, non-english language, and cult films. Recently the company has also started acquiring films for distribution in theaters, so MUBI is the exclusive home to acclaimed titles like Park Chan-Wook’s award-winning drama Decision to Leave. You can get a 7-day free trial, and thereafter pay $13 a month or $108 a year (a 31% discount).</p><h2 id="shudder">Shudder</h2><p>If you like horror, the idea of not subscribing to Shudder is scary. The service not only premieres new horror films, but has also given spotlight to long-neglected cult hits like 1981's Possession (never previously available in the U.S. in its original cut) and the Mexican supernatural flick Poison for the Fairies. You can get a 7-day free trial, and join up for $6 per month or $57 per year.</p><h2 id="dont-forget-about-free-services">Don’t forget about free services</h2><p>There is also a wide array of free TV and movie streaming options if you don’t feel like paying for your entertainment and you have exhausted your free trials. And if you’re concerned your monthly streaming bill is getting unwieldily, here are ten strategies to cut it down to size.</p><p></p><p></p><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/these-streaming-services-still-offer-free-trials-1846190471" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><b>Source: lifehacker.com</b></a></p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on January 3, 2025</div><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/authors/andre-yulianto/" title="Andre Yulianto">Andre Yulianto</a></h4></div></div><nav class="content__nav box"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/how-to-get-rid-of-old-furniture.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>How to Get Rid of Old Furniture</h5></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/how-to-get-rid-of-old-furniture.html" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>How to Get Rid of Old Furniture</h5></div></a></div></nav><div class="content__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related-wrap"><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/why-the-steam-deck-is-still-a-good-buy-in-2024.html" class="inverse">Why the Steam Deck Is Still a Good Buy in 2024</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-10T02:24" class="u-small">January 10, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/these-are-the-best-portable-projectors-for-2024.html" class="inverse">These Are the Best Portable Projectors for 2024</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-10T02:10" class="u-small">January 10, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="content__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="content__related-title"><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/top-50-best-free-legal-sites-to-download-new-movies-2024-quertime.html" class="inverse">Top 50 Best Free Legal Sites to Download New Movies (2024) - Quertime</a></h4><time datetime="2024-01-07T12:08" class="u-small">January 7, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/authors/andre-yulianto/" class="authors__title">Andre Yulianto</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 633</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="newsletter box box--gray"><h3 class="box__title">Newsletter</h3><p class="newsletter__description">Sign up to receive email updates and to hear what's going on with us!</p><form>...</form></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/tags/blog/">blog</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li><li><a href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/tags/lorem-ipsum/">lorem ipsum</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://andreyulianto0371.github.io/publii/">Go Blog</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

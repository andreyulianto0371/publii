Between news outlets and social media posts, reports flooded in from 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max users complaining their brand new iPhones were almost too hot to touch. Apple has just released an official fix, but there are other methods you can try to keep your phone’s temperature down too.</p><h2 id="why-does-the-iphone-15-pro-overheat">Why does the iPhone 15 Pro overheat?</h2><p>These heat spikes reportedly occurred during a variety of conditions. Some users noticed it <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ianzelbo/status/1706188289827381490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1706188289827381490%7Ctwgr%5Ec8c4fa609b17d97c8729e1513a0e1964edf6ec36%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fiphone-15-pro-overheating" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">while charging their 15 Pros</a>, while others found that heat would generate <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/too-hot-to-handle-iphone-15-pro-models-face-overheating-complaints" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">while chatting on the phone</a>. Without an official response from Apple, the running theory pointed to the new A17 Bionic chip. Apple’s latest and greatest is the most powerful chip the company ever put in a smartphone—perhaps it was too powerful. It seemed possible we were looking at a <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-2018-macbook-pro-has-a-problem-with-overheating/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">2018 MacBook Pro situation</a>, where the Intel i9 chip generated too much heat for the computer’s thin chassis to properly disperse.</p><p>However, Apple eventually <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-says-iphone-15-overheating-fix-ios-update-on-the-way" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">publicly commented on the overheating issue</a>, identifying three main culprits: First, Apple says iPhone 15 Pros may overheat during initial setup or after restoring the device, since there is an unusual amount of background activity during these periods. That tracks: A device tends to go through more intense periods of activity during initialization, because there are so many processes going on to get the device to a stable point. It’s why you may notice your smartphone’s battery life getting worse after a big update, and why it evens out after a bit.</p><p>If your iPhone 15 Pro is affected by this issue, the overheating should have slowed down after a period of use. However, it’s only one third of the possibilities here. The second cause of overheating is a bug in iOS 17 itself. Apple doesn’t get specific here, but they blame an issue in software for some overheating problems, and promises an imminent update to fix it.</p><p>Third, however, is related to third-party software. Apple says certain app updates have caused the software to “overload the system,” which can lead to overheating as well. The company specifically calls out Instagram, Uber, and the game Asphalt 9, but it’s possible other apps are at fault as well.</p><p>Notably, Apple made a point to say the 15 Pro’s design was not a factor in overheating issues. Some had theorized the new titanium metal Apple used in the phone was causing the devices to heat up more than they should.</p><h2 id="how-to-fix-overheating-on-your-iphone-15-pro">How to fix overheating on your iPhone 15 Pro</h2><p>If you haven’t yet, the best thing to do is to update your iPhone 15 Pro to iOS 17.0.3. Apple dropped the new update on Wednesday, Oct. 4, which, according to the update notes, “addresses an issue that may cause iPhone to run warmer than expected.”</p><p>In case you’re wondering, yes: The update really does fix the overheating issue. <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-pro-overheating-resolved-thermal-photos-before-and-after-ios-17-0-3/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">ZDNet took thermal images of their iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max</a> before and after the update, and the temperatures dropped considerably. Before the update, their devices would heat up above 100ºF whenever fast charging, and even reached 107.1º at one point. Post-update, however, the phones would hover between 85º to 95º at their hottest points, a big improvement.</p><p>Interestingly, iOS 17.0.3 is available on more than the iPhone 15, as the update <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213961" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">features two security patches</a> in addition to the overheating patch. You can update your iPhone to iOS 17.0.3 from <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong>.</p><p>Even after you update, however, there are other things to consider here. As Apple mentioned, some third-party apps are to blame, specifically updates that clearly are not properly optimized for the iPhone 15 Pro’s A17 chip. As such, make sure you update your apps frequently: While they’ll update on their own, it sometimes takes a while, so update them manually by tapping on your profile picture in the App Store. You may need to pull down on this page to refresh the list of available app updates.</p><p>According to Forbes, Meta already updated Instagram to address the overheating issue, and other apps are likely not far behind. At this point, they might have all updated to address the issue. That said, I also recommend disabling “Background App Refresh” for these apps from <strong>Settings &gt; General</strong>. Doing so will prevent apps like Instagram from running wild in the background, which avoids a potential overheating issue and saves you some battery life.</p><p>Personally, I keep Background App Refresh turned off for all apps, because I don’t need my apps dictating when they should pull new data in the background: If I want to refresh an app, I’ll open it myself, thank you very much. If you want to keep the feature on, but want an idea of which apps to disable it for, head to <strong>Settings &gt; Battery</strong>, and take a look at which apps are running in the background. Instagram, for example, is likely doing numbers when you’re not using it, so keep Background App Refresh turned off for good.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Jake Peterson is Lifehacker’s Senior Technology Editor.

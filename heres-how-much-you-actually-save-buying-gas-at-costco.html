The average cost for a gallon of gas in the U.S. is $3.873 and has been hovering around this same number for nearly two weeks, “a noteworthy length for price stability,” <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/gas-prices-are-stuck-in-neutral-but-for-how-long/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">according to AAA</a>. However, new data from the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Energy Information Administration (EIA)</a> suggests higher demand amid tighter supply, meaning pump prices could be on the rise again soon.</p><p>We all want to know how to get the most out of every drop of gas these days. Common consensus dictates that gas is always cheaper at warehouse clubs like Costco or Sam’s Clubs. An annual Costco membership is $60 for their Gold plan and $120 for an Executive membership. But if you’re not already part of the club, is it worth purchasing a Costco membership exclusively for the potential gas savings?</p><p>We did the math to see how much money you’d save if you bought a Costco membership now solely to take advantage of their gas prices for the rest of the year.</p><h2 id="is-it-worth-it-to-get-a-costco-membership-just-for-cheaper-gas">Is it worth it to get a Costco membership just for cheaper gas?</h2><p>Gas prices at outlets like Costco and Sam’s Club have, in the past, <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://abc7chicago.com/gas-prices-costco-sams-club-walmart/11257053/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">been reported</a> to be as much as 30 cents less per gallon than regular gas stations. Our goal here is to see if signing up for the most affordable Costco membership just to buy gas will save you money in the long run.</p><p>Small to midsize cars generally hold 12 gallons of gas, while trucks and larger SUVs could hold 16 gallons or more. For this experiment, let’s meet in the middle and use a 14-gallon fill-up as our benchmark. Also for math-related ease, let’s assume you fill your tank about once a week.</p><p>Because there’s no apparent difference in gas-related deals between the membership plans, we’ll work with their cheapest plan, which costs $60 annually.</p><p>I used the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">AAA Gas Prices map</a> and <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.gasbuddy.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">GasBuddy</a> to pull sample gas prices from one of the most affordable and one of the most expensive cities at the moment.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong>: Costco = $3.39 / Shell = $3.69 / Kroger = $3.65</p></li><li><p><strong>Inglewood, Calif.</strong>: Costco = $4.85 / Shell = $5.09 / Chevron = $5.39</p></li></ul><h3><strong>The cost of gas without a Costco membership</strong></h3><p>In Columbus, your cheapest non-Costco option is Kroger. You pay $3.65 per gallon x 14 gallons = $51.10 per tank. Fill up once a week, and you’re paying $2,657.20 in gas per year.</p><p>In Inglewood, you find a Shell to get $5.09 per gallon. It costs you $71.26 per tank, and $3,705.52 for the year.</p><h3><strong>The cost of gas with a Costco membership</strong></h3><p>In Columbus, $3.39 per gallon x 14 gallons = $47.46 to fill up your tank. If you fill you tank once a week, that’s $2,467.92 per year. Tack on the $60 for your Costco Gold membership that got you these prices in the first place, and you’re at $2,527.92.</p><p>In Inglewood, $4.85 per gallon x 14 gallons = $67.90 per tank, and $3,530.80 per year. Plus the cost of membership, and your total is $3,590.80.</p><p><strong>You save $3.64 per tank and $129.28 in gas per year in Ohio.</strong> </p><p><strong>You save $3.36 per tank and $114.72 in gas per year in California.</strong></p><p>To see how gas prices compare in your area, plug your zip code into <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.gasbuddy.com/home" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">GasBuddy</a>.</p><h2 id="other-considerations-like-that-huge-line">Other considerations (like that huge line)</h2><p>Some might consider a little over one hundred in savings less than astronomical (at least in places where gas is relatively cheaper already). However, weigh in the fact that you can use your Costco membership for other benefits, and the annual purchase could pay off in other, grocery-related ways.</p><p>Then again, you’re not exactly the first person thinking about joining the Costco club solely for their gas prices. In the past, Costcos across the nation have <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtFOvzyTtYk" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">made headlines</a> for ridiculously long lines at the station.</p><p>Finally, all of this depends on whether or not there’s even a Costco conveniently located near you. What if you have to waste gas driving out to a Costco station, and then wait in a long line once you’re there? In those cases, the gas savings might not be worth the additional hassle.</p><h2 id="the-takeaway-costco-gas-is-cheaper-for-members">The takeaway: Costco gas is cheaper for members</h2><p>On a yearly basis, the Costco Gold membership is worth its cost in gas savings. Plus, you’ll be able to use your membership for grocery and home goods shopping.</p><p>However, if you’d have to go out of your way to get to a Costco and you shudder at the prospect of waiting in extremely long lines for marginally cheaper gas, then the savings simply might not be worth it for you.</p><p>This post was originally published in March 2022 and was updated on Aug. 16, 2023 to reflect up-to-date gas prices.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Meredith Dietz is Lifehacker’s Senior Finance Writer.
